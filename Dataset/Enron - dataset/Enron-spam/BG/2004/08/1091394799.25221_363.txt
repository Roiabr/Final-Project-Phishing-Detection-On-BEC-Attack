Summer 2004 was too hot for the software manufacturers.<br>
No wonder! As the prices were reduced in 3-4 times.<br>
This was caused by the software glut on the world market.<br>
On the other hand the user who were not able or just had<br>
no time to update their software now have the possibility<br>
to do this almost free of charge.<br>
