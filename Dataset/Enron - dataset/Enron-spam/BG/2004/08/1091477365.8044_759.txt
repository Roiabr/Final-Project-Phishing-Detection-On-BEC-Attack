<br>While the couple were apparently examining the strange device, Rob
started to his feet and walked toward them
The crowd fell back at his approach, but the man and the girl were so
interested that they did not notice himHe was still several paces away when

To Rob's horror and consternation the big Turk began to rise slowly into
the air, while a howl of fear burst from the crowdBut the boy made a mighty

The big Turk screamed pitifully at first, and then actually fainted away
from frightRob was much frightened, on his part, for he knew if his hands
slipped from their hold he would fall to his death
