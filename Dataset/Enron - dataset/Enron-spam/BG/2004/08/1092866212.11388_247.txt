In a medium bowl, lightly whisk together the yolks and half of the 
sugar.  In a non-reactive saucepan combine the cream, 1 cup of the milk, the remaining sugar, and the salt. Split the vanilla bean in half, lengthwise, to expose the tar-like seeds inside the pod. Scrape the seeds loose with a knife; add the bean and the seeds to the cream mixture. Heat the cream over medium-high heat until just at a boil. Remove from the heat.
