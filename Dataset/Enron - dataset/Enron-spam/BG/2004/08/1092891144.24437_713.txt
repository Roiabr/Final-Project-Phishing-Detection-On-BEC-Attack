Hi,

My name is Deanna and I was asked by Swain to talk to you about
the benefits of the product that I am using.

I have been married for over 12 years now and lately, like all marriage's,
we have become more and more distant from each other.  We have not been
intimate in over 6 months.  Well about a month ago, I came across an email
that was selling these products that was guaranteed to help with our problem.
I was hesistant at first, but decided to go ahead and try it anyway.
To my surprise, it worked exactly as they said. 

It's not the miracle that will save a marriage but it will definatlely help
put the spark back into the relationship. I am trying to help as many people
as I can to find the happiness that once was. You should definately check it
out and tell me what you think.

Just get back to me and tell me if I was able to help you with this.

Thanks,

Lina Mcginnis
