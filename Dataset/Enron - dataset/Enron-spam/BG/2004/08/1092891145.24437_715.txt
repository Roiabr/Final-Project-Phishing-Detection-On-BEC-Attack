<br>Rob wondered why the Garment of Repulsion had not protected him from
the blow of the bird's wing; but, as a matter of fact, it had protected him
For it was not the wing itself but the force of the eddying currents of air
that had sent him whirling away from the monsterWith the indicator at zero
the magnetic currents and the opposing powers of attraction and repulsion
were so evenly balanced that any violent atmospheric disturbance affected
him in the same way that thistledown is affected by a summer breeze<A

He had noticed something of this before, but whenever a strong wind was
blowing he was accustomed to rise to a position above the air currentsThis
was the first time he had slept with the indicator at zero
The huge birds at once renewed their attack, but Rob had now recovered his
wits sufficiently to draw the electric tube from his pocketThe first one to
dart towards him received the powerful electric current direct from the
tube, and fell stunned and fluttering to the surface of the sea, where it
floated motionless
