MR. MR.BEL ZULU
SOUTH AFRICA 


DEAR SIR, 

I AM AN OFFICER CORPORATE BANKING DEPARTMENT OF 
TRUST BANK S.A.[SOUTH AFRICA] MY DEPARTMENT RELATES 
MORE WITH THE AFFAIRS OF THE STATE. VERY LATELY AN 
AMOUNT OF MONEY WAS DISCOVERED BY US IN A SUSPENSE / 
AN ABANDONED ACCOUNT TO THE SUM OF FIFTEEN POINT THREE 
MILLION US DOLLARS ONLY. AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGED TO 
ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS 
ENTIRE FAMILY ON NOVEMBER 1994 IN A GHASTLY AUTO
CRASH. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE 
HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND 
CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT RELEASE IT UNLESS 
SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR IT AS NEXT- OF-KIN, OR RELATION 
TO THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING 
GUIDELINES. UNFORTUNATELY, NOBODY HAS COME FOWARD TO 
CLAIM THIS MONEY.IT IS BASED ON THIS THAT SOME 
OFFICIALS IN MY DEPARTEMENT AND I HAVE DECIDED TO 
ESTABLISH A CORDIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, 
HENCE MY CONTACTING YOU. WE WANT YOU TO PRESENT 
YOURSELF AS THE NEXT-OF- KIN OR RELATION OF THE 
DECEASED SO THAT THE FUND CAN BE REMITTED INTO YOUR 
ACCOUNT. MOREOVER, WE DO NOT WANT THE MONEY TO GO INTO 
THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS UNCLAIMED BILL. 

THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATE THAT ANY 
ACCOUNT ABANDONED OR IS DORMANT FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS 
IS DEEMED CLOSED AND ALL MONEY CONTAINED THEREIN 
FORFEITED TO THE GOVERNMENT TREASURY ACCOUNT. 

NOW IT IS BEING SPECULATED THAT THE ABOVE SUM WILL BE 
TRANSFERED INTO THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS AN UNCLAIMED 
FUND ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 2004. THE REASON FOR 
REQUESTING YOU TO PRESENT YOURSELF AS NEXT-OF- KIN IS 
OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE DECEASED (CUSTOMER) 
WAS A FOREIGNER. 

THE MODE OF SHARING AFTER A SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE 
MONEY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT: 70% TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I; 
FOR THE ROLE YOU WILL BE EXPECTEDTO PLAY IN THIS DEAL, 
WE HAVE AGREED TO GIVE YOU TWENTY FIVE PERCENT (25%) OF THE 
TOTAL SUM, AND 5% FOR THE EXPENSES WE ARE GOING TO 
ENCOUNTER BY THE TWO PARTIES AT THE COURSE OF THIS 
TRANSACTION.THEREFORE YOU ARE EXPECTED TO REPLY 
THIS LETTER INDICATING YOUR READINESS AND INTEREST TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THIS BUSINESS. 

AFTER RECEIVING YOUR REPLY,YOU WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO WITH 
THE EXACT STEPS TO TAKE. I EXPECT YOUR URGENT RESPONSE 

NOTE ALSO THAT FOR SECURITY REASONS I WOULD'T BE ABLE 
TO SPEAK TO YOU DURING OFFICE HOURS HENCE I SHALL GIVE 
YOU MY PRIVATE NUMBER WHERE YOU CAN ALWAYS REACH ME AT 
THE PROPER TIME. PLEASE TREAT THIS BUSINESS ! PROPOSAL 
AS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL FOR SECURITY REASONS. AS ALL 
THE TOP OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS HERE DO NOT 
WANT TO GET INTO TROUBLE AS A RESULT OF INDECENT 
PUBLICITY. 

KIND PERSONAL REGARDS, 

MR.BEL ZULU
