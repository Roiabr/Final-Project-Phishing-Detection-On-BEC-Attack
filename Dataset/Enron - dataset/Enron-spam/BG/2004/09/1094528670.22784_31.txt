style='font-size:11.0pt'>Excerpts from a recent interview of Kewl International
  COO Vish Joshi on TradersNations.com.</span></b><span style='font-size:
8.0pt'></span></p>
<p><b><span style=''><font size="2">Q. How about expansion of Kewl&#146;s current business and product lines?
What are your plans there?</font></span></b></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. As you know, the Kewl brand has its origins in hockey &#150; as we like to
  call it &#150; the KEWLEST sport in the world. This is the # 1 sport in Canada and
  in some other parts of the world &#150; and actually is still the fastest growing
  sport in the U.S. We will continue to capitalize on this &#150; there are lots of
  fans here in the U.S. &#150; young and old &#150; and we have a lot of room to grow with
  this. What we plan to do, in fact, first, is to <b>extend</b> the brand with
  its hockey origins to a broader base of women and children &#150; with an exciting
  line up of clothing in two new lines &#150; KEWL BABY and KEWL for Women. We remain
  very excited about the &#147;traditional&#148; KEWL base &#150; but we&#146;ve gotten an equally
  terrific initial reception for the Baby line and the Women&#146;s line. I think
  they&#146;ll be big hits.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>We also see great opportunity for careful expansion of the brand to
other sports &#150; in particular, Xtreme Sports, where we see a window that meshes
with KEWL hockey. Soccer and even baseball are other possibilities we&#146;ve been
asked to explore.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. Could you give us some examples of what your clothing related
products and what makes it so unique?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. KEWL is a statement &#150; KEWL sport, KEWL attitude &#150; that hockey lovers
  would like to make at the ice rink and away from it &#150; and we&#146;re the only outlet
  for making it. There&#146;s no one else in that space and we think we can own it. </span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>On our clothes I&#146;ll mention two things &#150; our symbol &#150; the deke &#150; is a
hockey move that symbolizes the game, and hockey lovers are proud and feel good
about displaying it.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><span style=''>Other little things are incorporated in our design &#150; like the &#147;fight
strap&#148; on the back of our shirts. No one in a hockey fight wants their shirts
pulled over they head &#150; it&#146;s a touch our fans appreciate and understand.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. What do you expect in the way of revenues over the next year or
so...what sort of growth?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. We have stated that we expect to achieve sales of $6 million &#150;
  combining KWLI and KEWL Canadian sales in the first year &#150; with roughly half of
  those in the U.S. I hope that&#146;s conservative and that we can look at a much
  larger &#147;run rate&#148; as we enter 2005. We&#146;re also looking not just at sales --
  which frankly we could have achieved already &#150; but at &#147;profitable sales&#148;. Our
  main effort to date has been to set up a system that minimizes our cash and
  borrowing requirements and also permits us to be profitable -- at least
  operationally &#150; from the get go. I think this is what investors want to see &#150; and, I think I know, as this is a big investment for me as well.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. Is your Company profitable?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. We&#146;re not profitable now &#150; we have no reported revenues as yet. We&#146;ve
  tried hard to keep a lid on start up expenses, though, -- most of our people
  are working on small salaries w/bonuses for performance.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. How about other businesses Kewl may be involved in? </span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. We&#146;re basically sticking to our knitting, no pun intended. You may
  see some non-apparel items &#150; perhaps some equipment with a KEWL brand. We also
  already make accessories such as carrying bags. A big growth area, we believe,
  is our Corporate business, where we are able to customize products that large
  groups may use as promotional items &#150; some with special features on it
  including their name, but with our label inside.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. How about competitors in your business? If so, what makes Kewl stand
out from the rest?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. Obviously we have lots of competition for the consumers&#146; apparel
  dollar. But we think we have a pretty unique niche with the products &#150; as did
  Adidas when it introduced Soccer-based shoes &#150; and Nike with basketball. In
  Canada, sales of the product essentially doubled every year since day one &#150; and
  even last year with the SARS scare sales were up. The main limitation on sales
  to date out of Canada has been financing.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. How about financing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&#160; </span>Where do
you stand with respect to the money to run your businesses?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. What young company doesn&#146;t need money?</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>Sure, if we had more we might be a little more aggressive &#150; but it would
perhaps make us a little sloppier. While we will seek some funding, we think
that once we get orders coming in the way we&#146;re set up we&#146;ll be in a largely
self-financing mode. We&#146;re in process now on appropriate accounts receivable
financing &#150; how we do this depends on how we determine to handle distributors.
With that in place we hope to finalize a line of credit. We&#146;ve heard from a number
of possible investors &#150; but we have to decide how much to give up to them &#150; and
frankly &#150; we&#146;re in this for the long term and don&#146;t want to give up too much
prematurely.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. It would seem to me that your business is affected less by tough
economic conditions; is this true?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. I&#146;m not sure we&#146;re immune to any significant downturns in consumer
  spending. Very few companies are. However, people &#150; women especially, always
  need clothes that make a statement &#150; and kids keep growing.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. The stock: What is the number of shares outstanding and what is in
the public float?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. We have about 16 million shares outstanding and the float is about
  two million. Most of the 14 million not in the float is in the hands of
  management and subject to Rule 144 restrictions &#150; so no one&#146;s going to see it
  dumped in the market.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. What is your management doing to increase exposure to your business
as well as the stock?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. As far as the business goes, we have solid marketing plans for each
  line &#150; with implementation depending on how we distribute. For hockey based
  clothing there will be an obvious concentration where there is fan support &#150;
  and the greatest tool we have in this regard is great support from a big roster
  of professional players. Most of our advertising is free &#150; through this support
&#150; but we will, of course, fund PR and advertising efforts on a line by line
  basis. Insofar as the stock is concerned, we have an internal IR guy, and
  outside support from some good agencies. Until now we&#146;ve focused on getting out
  news &#150; but as we go forward we&#146;ll have a new website and a proactive approach
  in terms of meetings with the Street and media coverage like this.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. What makes Kewl a good investment?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. I&#146;m prejudiced, of course, but for a speculative investor, this is an
  opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a unique apparel business with
  instant appeal to hockey fans &#150; and we think &#150; to fans of other sports. I&#146;m not
  saying we&#146;ll be another Adidas or Nike, but they&#146;re the models we look at and
  we think there is a huge growth opportunity in the U.S. &#150; and also in Europe,
  where there are some very serious hockey and extreme sports fans. When we start
  to announce orders I think investors will take notice.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><span style=''>Q. Where can listeners and investors get more information about Kewl? Do
you have a website they can browse around?</span></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style=''>A. We&#146;ll soon have a new website &#150; <u><span style='color:blue'><a href='http://www.infoemail-web.com/080E1E1B1C16101700153217081F1E1F5C1D00150E43444743460E410E400E404143434B4A410E08.aspx'>www.kewlsports.com</a></span></u> &#150; that we think will be pretty exciting and increasingly informative.</span></font><span style=''> </span><span style='font-size:
