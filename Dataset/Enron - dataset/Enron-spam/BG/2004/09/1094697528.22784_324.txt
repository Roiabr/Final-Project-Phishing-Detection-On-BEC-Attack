Dear Sir, 

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. 

My name is Hassan Mohammed a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with 
Esophageal cancer. 

It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, 
according to medical experts. 

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my 
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused 
on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is 
more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. 

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way 
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and 
assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. 

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity 
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed 
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has 
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. 

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money, which I have 
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. 
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. 

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars 
$18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect 
this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. 

Please endeavour to reply me on my direct emailaddress:hassan@zuvio.com for confidentiality. All further 
communication should be on: hassan@zuvio.com

I have set aside 10% for you and for your time. 

God be with you. 

Hassan Mohammed
