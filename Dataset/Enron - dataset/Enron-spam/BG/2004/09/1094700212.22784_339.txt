 ATTN:DICRETOR/CEO, 

                                                
Urgent & Confidential. 

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me
since you do not know me personally. I am USMAN ZOLA,
the only son of Mr.Micheal ZOLA, who was recently
murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your
contact address through network online hence decided
to write you. 

Before the death of my father, he had taken me to
Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$18
Million(Eighteen Million United States Dollars), in
one of the private security company, as if he foresaw
the looming danger in my country Zimbabwe. This money
was deposited in a box as germ stones to avoid huge
demurrage from the Security Company. 

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines
and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new
farmland in Swaziland. This land problem came when
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe introduced a new
Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to
the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans
and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of
people were killed because of this land reformed Act
for which my father was one of the victims. 

It is against this background that, I and my family
who are currently staying in South Africa decided to
transfer my father's money to a foreign country since
the law of South Africa prohibits refugees open any
bank account or to be involved in any financial
transactions throughout the territorial zones of South
Africa. As the only son of my father, I am saddled
with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign
account where this money could be transferred into
without the knowledge of my government who are bent on
taking everything. 

All I seek for is an honest businessman, whom I can
entrust my future and that of my family, I must also
let you know that this transaction is 100%risk free.
If you accept to assist me and my family all I want
from you is for you to make arrangements and come to
Johannesburg South Africa, so that you can help me in
pulling out the whole fund at the security company and
also to open a non-resident account in your name which
will aid us in transferring the money into any account
you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use
for investment growth in your country. 

I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to
have certain percentage of the money for nominating
your account for this transaction, or you can go into
partnership with me for the proper profitable
investment of the money in your country.Whichever
option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also
mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses
we might incur on the process of this transaction. If
you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give
you 25% of the money while the remaining will remain
for me and my family. If you are really capable and
willing to assist me please contact me immediately
with the above telephone, or this e-mail address with
which I have sent you this message. 

Finally, please treat this matter as urgent as
possible, I?m in dare need to leave this country
soonest. 

Thanks for your mutual co-operation, as I expect your
soonest response. 

Kind Regards,  
USMAN ZOLA.
