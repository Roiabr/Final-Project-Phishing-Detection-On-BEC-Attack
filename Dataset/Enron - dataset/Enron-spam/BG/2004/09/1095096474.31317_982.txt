The evening was cool for the time of year, and the heat from the fire w=
as cheering and grateful; so they all lay near the glowing embers and fe=
ll fast asleep

nd gazing around he saw several rudely dressed men approaching
<br>

 waited for the strangers to draw near
They seemed to be fishermen, and were much surprised at finding three p=
eople asleep upon the bluff
