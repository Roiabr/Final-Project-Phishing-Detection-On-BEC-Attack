<BR>It can be debated which design appropriately examines the clinical
interpretation of synergism studies comparing same or different  lactams 
Synergism has been defined as a 2 log10 or greater reduction in bacterial
count with the combination versus that with each of the agents alone 86 In
studies comparing the same  lactam this is directly tested but the effect of
increasing the antibiotic spectrum cannot be separated from a synergistic
effect  <BR>
