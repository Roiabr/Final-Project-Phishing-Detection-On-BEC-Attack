rrowed all the waters of the Northern Pacific, running at whales, making s=
harp deviations from her course, veering suddenly from one tack to another=

sk of deranging her machinery, and not one point of the Japanese or Americ=
an coast was left unexplored. "If, sir, you would not squint so much, you =
would see better!"=20.=20
