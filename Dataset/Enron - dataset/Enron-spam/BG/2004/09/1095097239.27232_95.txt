Dear Friend. 

                                                  TOP SERCRT 




                                RE: REMITTANCE OF US$14,000,000:00 

I am a the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance departm=
ent
 African Developpement Bank .I am writing, following your address which
i got through international network information when iwas searching for
a sure email contact because of the urgency of this transaction.And i hop=
e
of your  relaibility to champion this business opportunity with me.In my
department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$14m US dollars (FOURTEEN=

MILLION USD) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer wh=
o
died along with his entire family in November 1999 in a plane crash.Since=

we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of ki=
n
to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some=
body
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in=

our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane cra=
sh
leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery
that I  now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the=

money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety an=
d
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want
this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking la=
w
and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after
five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclai=
med
fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in this business is occassion=
ed
by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stan=
d
as next of kin to a foreigner. 
We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for
expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me. There after=

I  will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages
indicated.Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you=

as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin
of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your=

private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and=

location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply,
I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application. I will
not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and
that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangemen=
ts
have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soo=
n
as you receive this letter for more explanations. 

Yours faithfully

AKIM BELLO
