MONEY TRANSACTION</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>My name is Dr. Jeff Machati, and I work in the
International operation department in a Local Bank here in South
Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant
domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 36,000,000 (Thirty Six
Million USD) on further discreet investigation, I also
discovered that the account holder has long since passed away
(dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The bank will approve this money to any foreigner
because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from
Iraq in particular and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and
nobody will come again for the claim of this money A foreigner
can only claim this money with legal claims to the account
Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I
will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim
this money, But you will need to open an account where this can
be transferred.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>If interested send your private
Telephone No. And Fax number including full details of the
account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost
confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the
future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached. I
want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due
process is followed accordingly. Finally, I will give you 25%
for your corporation. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I look forward to your earliest reply through my
email.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BR>Yours,</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BR>Dr. Jeff Machati.</STRONG></P>
