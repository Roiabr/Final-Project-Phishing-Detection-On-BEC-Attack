co-ordinate projects and development at the national level, furthermore,
from this projects we have been able to secured some Reasonable amount of=

u.s.$21.8(Twenty one  million eight hundred thousand US. dollars only)as
commission from various contractors resulting from over invoicing ,hence
all the necessary approvals has been completed.

These approved fundS was packaged and dispatched through a security
company for onward delivery to its Destination in Europe.

These fundS was first deposited into a security vault before we arrange

fund on our behalf from the security company.

high integrity /dignity and one with conscience who will claim this fund
on our behalf as the beneficiary , and we have agreed to give you 25% of
