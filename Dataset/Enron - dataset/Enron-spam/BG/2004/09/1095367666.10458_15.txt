for a life spent in this huge sameness? He is cut off from books, from news,
from company, from all that can relieve existence but the prosecution of his
affairs.</font><br>

<font style="font-size: 1;">In this country, as in all others they had
visited underneath the earth's surface, there was no night, a constant and
strong light coming from some unknown source</font><br>

in which to sleep or doze</font><br>

A sky full of stars is the most varied spectacle that he can hope. He may
walk five miles and see nothing; have been long disused. A great, uneasy
stillness lay upon the world. There was no sign of the farm-folk or of any
live stock, save for an old, brown, curly dog of the retriever breed, who
sat close in against the wall of the house and seemed to be dozing.
Something about this dog disquieted the dreamer;<br>
<br>
it was quite a nameless feeling, for the beast looked right enough -
indeed, he was so old and dull and dusty and broken-down, that he should
rather have awakened pity; and yet the conviction came and grew upon the
dreamer that this was no proper dog at all, but something hellish. A great
