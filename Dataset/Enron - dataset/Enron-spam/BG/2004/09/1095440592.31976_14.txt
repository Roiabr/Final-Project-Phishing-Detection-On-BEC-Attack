                                FAMILY REQUEST FOR HELP
 
Attn: Director / CEO, 
 
    My name is Andy Mosidi, the elder son of Mr. Bongani Mosidi of Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address. I got your address from the South African Chamber of Commerce in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
 
  During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. 
 
  My father is one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not support Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and made away with a lot of items in my father's farm. 
 
  Before his death, my father had deposited with one of the Security Company in Johannesburg, South Africa the sum of US$14.6 Million (Fourteen Million Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). With my name, and made every documents with my name both the certificate of depository. 
 
  Then after the death of my father, we decided to move to the Republic of South Africa where he had deposited the money in the Security Company as valuables. So, I decided to contact you to assist me to transfer this money out of South Africa because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to operate any bank account within South Africa. 
 
  We have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction and 70% will be for me and my family to invest in your country. 
 
  All I want you to do is to furnish me with your full personal phone and fax numbers for easy communication, and try to contact me immediately on my private E-mail address (mr_andymo@yahoo.ca) or above telephone number. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely confidential. 
 
  Thanks and God bless. 
 
  Best Regards, 
Mr. Andy Mosidi, 
(For The family).
