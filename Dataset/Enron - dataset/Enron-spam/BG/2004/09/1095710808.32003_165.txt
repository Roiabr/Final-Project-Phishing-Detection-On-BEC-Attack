PLEASE GIVE ME AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
This is to seek your cooperation as my foreign partner and 
your assistance to enable me own a property and invest in 
the stable economy of your country. Accept my apologies if 
this mail does not suit your personal or business ethics.
My name is Dr Sada Emma,I am making this venture 
proposal to you in strict confidence. The money we want to 
invest was acquired from an over invoiced contract 
proceed. This is in 
my capacity as the chairperson of the senate financial 
committee on foreign contracts verification and payments 
(Member, Contract Review Panel [CRP]). Our good fortune is 
that we are privy to 
such classified information.
The amount in question is $25,500,000.00 USD(twenty fiveMillion,five Hundred Thousand USD. As a senior civil 
servant in the Nigerian Government, our country's 
prudential policy prohibits me from operating a foreign 
account. If you would like to assist me as a partner, 
please kindly indicate your interest after which we shall 
both discuss on the modalities.
All other information to facilitate the remittance of the 
funds will be revealed to you in due course. For your 
assistance, you shall receive 25% of the funds to be 
transferred and 5% will be set aside for all expenses 
incurred by both parties.
I would appreciate if this proposal is kept confidential 
because of what I have explained above. Note that you can 
reach me urgently on my e-mail, telephone/ fax 
number(American internet fax number, which I believe is 
more secure).
Please do indicate your direct telephone and fax number 
when replying to this business proposal. I will be calling 
you when necessary. In the meantime, I will appreciate if 
you can call me or make your contacts through my mail. 
A swift acknowledgement on the receipt of this mail will 
be appreciated.
Best regards,
Dr.Sada Emma
