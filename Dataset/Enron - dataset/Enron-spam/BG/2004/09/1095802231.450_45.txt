Good day,
I am contacting you because of a business concerning a huge sum of 
money from a deceased deposit in the Security and Finance company where I 
work here in Netherlands. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that
all will be well at the end of the day. I actually decided to contact
you due to the urgency of this transaction.
PROPOSITION;
I discovered an abandoned deposit in my company owned by one of our
foreign customers who died along with his entire family as a result of
an automobile crash. He actually deposited
this funds amounting to US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve million united states dollars), for safe
keeping in my company here in Amsterdam. Company file records shows 
that the funds was actually for a project our late costumer wanted to start
in the near future (a multi million Dollar steel plant in Florida, USA),
before his sudden and untimely death. As such since his death none of
his relations or next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this
funds as the heir, this is the basically the reason why I have
contacted you. My company cannot release the property unless someone
applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in 
our operating  guidelines.
Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a
Next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will
be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released in your favor as the
Beneficiary’s next of kin. It may interest you to know that I have
Secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of deceased
Beneficiaries . Please acknowledge receipt of this message in 
acceptance of our mutual business, endeavor by furnishing me with the following;
1. Beneficiary full name and address
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers
3. Occupation and position
4. Nationality and Date of birth
5. Marital status
6. Gender/sex
These requirements will enable me file letter of claim to the
appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favor before
you can personally appear for the claim. I shall be compensating you
with 30% of the total money while 10% will be for any expenses
incurred the rest will be mine on final conclusion of this project. Please note
that your share stays while the rest shall before me for investment
purposes.
If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of
the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail. Please 
reply by email:danvictorina@mail2dan.com
Best Regards,
Daniel Victorina
