ATTN:Sir/Madam, 

            URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE 

First, I must solicit your confidence in this 
transaction; this is by virtue if it's nature as being 
utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though I know 
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that 
all will be well at the end of the day. We have 
decided to contact you due to the urgency of this 
transaction, as we have been reliably informed of your 
discreteness and ability in transactions of this 
nature. 
Let me start by first introducing myself properly to 
you. I am MR.JOHN NUMVETTE ,a Branch Manager with 
a big bank of Johannesburg, South Africa. I came to 
know of you in my private search for a reliable and 
reputable person to handle this confidential 
transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum 
of money to a foreign account requiring maximum 
confidence. 
THE PROPOSITION: 
A foreigner, Late Engineer Johnson Creek, an Gold 
Merchant/Contractor with the Government of South 
Africa, until his death one year ago in a ghastly air 
crash, banked with us here in South Africa. , and had 
a closing balance of US$26.5M (Twenty Six Million, Five 
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which the bank 
now unquestionably expects it to be claimed by any 
available foreign next-of-kin of the Late beneficiary 
or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust 
fund for arms and ammunition at a military war college 
here in South Africa. Fervent valuable efforts are 
being made by the Bank to get in touch with any of 
the Creek family or relatives but proved unsuccessful. 
It is because of the perceived possibility of not 
being able to locate any of Late Engr. Johnson Creek's 
next-of-kin (he had no known wife and children) that 
the management under the influence of our chairman and 
member of the board of directors are preparing for the 
fund to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE" and subsequently be 
donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition to 
further enhance the course of arm building in Africa 
and the world in general. 
In order to avert this negative development, some of 
my trusted colleagues and I now seek your permission 
to have you stand as a next-of-kin to Late Engr. 
Johnson Creek so that the funds US$26.5M would be 
released and paid into your bank account as the 
beneficiary next-of-kin. All documents and proves to 
enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out 
and more so we are assuring you of a 100% risk free 
involvement. Your share stays while the rest would be 
for me and my colleagues for investment purposes in 
your country. 
We have agreed that, the funds will be shared thus, 
after it has been transferred into your account: 
30% of the money will go to you for acting as the 
beneficiary of the funds. 5% will be set aside for 
reimbursement to both parties for any incidental 
expenses that may be incurred in the course of the 
transfer. 65% to us the originators of the 
transaction. 
If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to 
take undue advantage of the trust, we hope to bestow 
on you and your company, then kindly get to me 
immediately. I will like you to furnish me with your 
most confidential telephone, fax number for further 
information on the release and subsequent transfer of 
the funds in your favour. 
Thank you in advance for your anticipated 
Co-operation. 

Yours faithfully,
 
Mr. JOHN NUMVETTE
