ATTN: 

This Letter Was First Sent To You Via Post Mail Two Months Ago but until Now, I Have Not Heard From You. Based On This, I Decided To Reach You through This Means. Though, 

I Know For Security Reasons, This Is Not The Safest Means To Reach You, But Was Left With No Other Viable Option Since There Is The Pressing Need To Reach You. 

I Am Quite Sure That This Mail Will Surprise You Since I Have Not Been Having Previous Correspondences With You. 

 Please I am PRINCE AKIN JR , the only son of late chief George AKIN from Sierra Leone. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of Fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) now in the custody of  a  private security company  here in  South Africa  to your private account pending our arrival to your country.

 My late father, chief GEORGE AKIN, a native of mende district in the Northern province of Sierra .Leone, was the general Manager of Sierra Leone mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown. According to my father. This money was the income accrued from mining co-operation's over draft and minor sales. Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of major  Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power o the Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family, my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to South Africa  with our personal effects.

 My father deposited the fund at a private security company in South Africa for the safe custody until after the war when he will join us. During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of public and Government properties by the rebel in forces, the sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the targets looted and destroyed.

 My father including other top Government functionaries Were attacked and killed by the rebels in November 2002 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. As a result of my father death, and with the news of my uncles involvement in air crash in January, dashed our hope of survival.

 The untimely deaths caused my mothers heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital After we must have spent a lot of money on her. Now my 18-year-old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like refugees and orphans. Our only hope now is in fund our father deposited in the private security company   To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways. To assist me claim this fund from the security company as a co-beneficiary. To

transfer this money in your name to your country. To make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our behalf in your country and you, the caretaker. To secure a college for my little sister and my self in your country to further our education. And to make arrangement for our travel with you to your country after you have transferred this fund. Most importantly. The whole documents issued after deposit in my custody.

 For your assistance, I beg to concede 10% of this money to you for your efforts assistance.

 Best regards

 PRINCE AKIN JR [FOR THE FAMILY]
