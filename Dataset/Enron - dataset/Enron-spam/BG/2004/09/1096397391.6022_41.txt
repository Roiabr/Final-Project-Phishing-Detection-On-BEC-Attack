Dear friend,

Greetings to you and your family! This mail might come to you as a surpri=
se
and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind;
but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of
humility. My name is Jose A. Martinez. I am a 64 years old man, I am Cuba=
n
currently residing in Dubai (United Arab Emirate). I was formerly living
in Cuba and served under Castro`s government but had to run into self exi=
le
after the ruling Government of Fidel Castro closed in on my family on acc=
usations
of anti-government statements, I was once married with two children but
my family could not escape before the deadly hands of Castro`s goons fell=

on them. l did made a lot of money serving Castro and on getting to UAE,
I have been a merchant here in Dubai dealing in Ornamentals, Oriental Car=
pets
and Artifacts and life was very smooth for me until about three(3) years
ago when I was first diagnosed of Cancer of the Larynx.
Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I
lived for, I never really cared about other values in life. But since the=

loss of my family and hometown, I have found a new desire to assist helpl=
ess
families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I ha=
ve
once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan=

and some East European Countries. Before I became ill, I kept $ 4.5 Milli=
on
in a long-term deposit vault of a security/finance company and I didn`t
state any next of kin when the money was deposited and if I died without
stating any the money will automatically go into the coffers of the secur=
ity
company and I don`t want this to happen. I have left the hospital and pre=
sently
receiving treatment in an acupuncture clinic, I have been undergoing trea=
tment
for Oesophageal Cancer at the hospital. I have since lost my ability to
talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live.
It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations=
.


Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since
my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsi=
bility
to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect
the deposit and distribute it amongst charity organizations. Use your jud=
gement
to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you have=

the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and dis=
tributing
the money to charity organizations. I am going to send you vital document=
s
to back my claims and I am willing to offer you a reward If you are willi=
ng
to help, please reply as soon as you can on my alternate email address:
( josemartinez@starmail.com ) . Looking forward to hearing from you soone=
st.

Regards,
J. A Martinez
