Homeland Security Technology, Inc. OTC - HSTJ<br>
Immediate Buy - HUGE NEWS plus a 30% Stock Dividend<br>
Current Price .013<br>
Target Price for Sept. 30  .085<p>

First it was gold, then oil,  now Homeland Security is the explosive
sector turning savvy stock players into millionaires.  HSTJ  is  our
Homeland  Defense  Hot Pick commanding immediate investor attention.
HSTJ is an extremely undervalued player in the hottest market sector
while simultaneously  declaring  a  stock  dividend  of  30%. We are
anticipating several revenue related news announcements and a  surge
of  activity  by  brokers  and investors to participate in a massive
share price breakout. Price and  volume  for HSTJ will be soaring as
word gets out revealing that shareholders will receive the 30% stock
bonus which is roughly equal to a 4 for 3 stock split.<p>

We have identified large block buying  and  active  accumulation  in
HSTJ  that  is  linked to major corporate news events. HSTJ supplies
military combat gear for the US Armed Forces and was formed for this
purpose by highly decorated military leaders. Not surprisingly, HSTJ
has experienced a strong increase  in monthly orders. Keep watch for
an expanded product line as hinted by the Company in recent press in
conjunction with additional orders.<p>

Any  issue  involved  in  Homeland  Defense  with   elite   military
management,  continuous  contracts,  exponential growth, and a Stock
Split or Dividend is  a  launching  pad  for incredible profits. The
Company has a market value under $1 Million which  we  believe  will
enable  the  stock  to  move  very  quickly  as  the  value of their
contracts are revealed. We expect  the  30% stock dividend to create
an added frenzy by investors loading up before HSTJ goes through the
roof.<p>
