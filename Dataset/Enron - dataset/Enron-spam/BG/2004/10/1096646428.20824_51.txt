What if a  company  had  a  product  that  would  allow oil wells to
produce much more oil?<p>

What would that stock be worth with todays oil prices  close  to  50
USD per barrel?<p>

10,  20, 30, 100 USD? and now several of the major oil companies are
currently testing the product.<p>

At 0.50 we think SQNC is a homerun.<p>

To  solve  this  problem,  the  oil  industry  is  looking  for  new
alternatives for  increased  exploration  and  production. The clear
solution for increased demand and consumption can already  be  found
in  the  ground, with nearly two thirds of oil left in the ground at
US wells,  too  technically  complex  or  expensive  to extract with
traditional technologies. Enhanced oil recovery, EOR, is an exciting
new frontier in the oil and gas industry which you are going to hear
more  of  in  the  coming  years.  SQNCs  innovative  new   product,
DiamondFlo, could be at the forefront of this frontier.<p>

SQNC  has  strong  interest  from  major  oil  and gas companies for
testing and potential licensing of this product, and is in the final
stages of the research  and  development of DiamondFlo. With testing
expected to be completed in the next 60  to  90  days,  and  planned
patent application shortly thereafter, announcements from SQNC could
cause  price  gains  for  this stock over the coming months. What is
more, DiamondFlos  unique  chemical  properties,  make  it  an ideal
solution for a number of  other  application  in  the  oil  and  gas
industry,  including  remediation  and  environmental cleanup of oil
fields, refineries, and storage facilities; an estimated 8.1 billion
market. With this revolutionary product in the development pipeline,
SQNC has also made some aggressive moves into oil and gas production
with its recent acquisition of  leases in Pecos Valley, Texas. These
operations will act as a testbed for development and  validation  of
the  DiamondFlo  product  and  could  provide  an additional revenue
stream and source of cash flow for SQNC.<p>

With the commercialization of  its  DiamondFlo product looming near,
we feel that it  is  only  a  matter  of  time  before  Wall  Street
recognizes  this  stock.  What is more, SQNC is positioned within an
industry that has seen tremendous  upside  growth, and is headed for
even  more  appreciation  as  the  global  oil  crisis  demands  new
production solutions. Over the last  twelve  months,  the  oil  well
services  and  equipment  industry has seen an average price gain of
more than 88 percent, and savvy investors in emerging companies have
witnessed tremendous pr0fits. We  believe  that  SQNC  is one of the
most  revolutionary  new  companies  on  the  market.   With   major
announcements stemming from the completion of R and D on DiamondFlo,
do you think SQNC could make a nice move in the coming day?.<p>

A Few Reasons to Own SQNC.<p>

1.  With  its  innovative  DiamondFlo product, SQNC is positioned to
help alleviate the  impending  oil  and  gas  crisis, with producers
struggling to keep up with growing US  energy  demands,  as  foreign
exploration  and  production  comes  under  increasing  geopolitical
pressures.  Increased  consumption  demands  have  combined  with an
increasingly unstable  international  production  climate  to create
some of the highest prices seen at the  pump  since  the  1970s  oil
embargo,  and  crude  oil  prices  on  the spot market have recently
approached the 50  USD  mark.  As  oil  companies  seek  new ways to
maximize domestic oil recovery, the chemical EOR  approach  of  SQNC
will  be  a  major  factor  in  increasing  production  and removing
dependence on foreign oil.<p>

2. Enhanced oil recovery, EOR,  represents  the logical next step in
expanding domestic oil production, and represents a  tremendous  and
presently  underappreciated market potential. Over two thirds of oil
in US reservoirs  is  left  unproduced  after  primary and secondary
production, leaving an incredible and untapped source for US  energy
needs.  According  to  the  US  Department  of  Energy,  EOR has the
potential to recover 35 billion barrels of oil, 50 percent more than
the current US  proven  reserves  of  23  billion  barrels, and even
greater than the US estimated undiscovered potential of  30  billion
barrels.  With  its  DiamondFlo chemical EOR solution, SQNC could be
ideally positioned to  benefit  from  a  renewed focus on production
from these untapped oil reserves.<p>

3.  SQNC  has  developed  a  revolutionary  chemical  EOR   product,
DiamondFlo  which  offers tremendous advantages over thermal and gas
EOR methods. Thermal and  gas,  primarily CO2 injection to stimulate
production are costly and require a  complex  infrastructure,  while
other  chemical  EOR  products  have  had  limited  success  and are
environmentally damaging.  By  contrast,  DiamondFlo  is expected to
generate recovery of 20 to 40  percent  above  current  methods,  is
environmentally  safe  and meets strict regulatory standards for oil
recovery and remediation, and  will  be  available to producers at a
comparable price point to competitive products. With introduction of
DiamondFlo  to  the  market  following  completion  of  testing  and
development, SQNC could revolutionize the oil and gas industry  with
this innovative approach to enhanced oil recovery.<p>

4. In addition to its principal application in EOR, SQNCs DiamondFlo
product  has  additional applications in the 8.1 Billion oil and gas
remediation  market.  During  the  testing  process,  DiamondFlo has
demonstrated  exceptional  remediation   properties,   with   static
remediation  tests  determining that it removed more than 80 percent
of hydrocarbons from soil  with no significant hydrocarbon emulsion,
mixing of oil and water. This discovery paves the way  for  eventual
application  in  environmental  cleanup of oil facilities or spills,
and opens up  a  tremendous  new  market  for  SQNC. Since 1992, the
American Petroleum Industry estimates that over 90 billion has  been
spent  by  the oil and gas industry to protect the environment, with
8.1 billion spent annually in environmental expenditures.<p>
