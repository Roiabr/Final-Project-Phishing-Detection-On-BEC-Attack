ATTN: MD/CEO

I am  David eto , Branch Manager with Bank of the North, Victoria Island
Branch, Lagos, Nigeria.I have an urgent and very profitable business
proposition for you that should be handled withextreme
confidentiality.On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant and
contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Mr.
James Herbert by name made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve
calendar months valued at US$25.6M (Twenty five Million, Six Hundred
United States Dollars Only) in my branch.Upon maturity I sent a routine
notification in accordance with the Bank policy to his forwarding
address but got no reply.After a month we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile
accident.On further investigation, we found out that he died without
making a Will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I
therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. James
Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official
documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of
US$25.6M has been carefully moved out of my bank to a Security Company
in Europe for safe keeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it and
according to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 years the money will
revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to
claim the fund.This prompted us to contact you.We will like to front you
as the next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal
beneficiary of the sum of $25.6 million U.S Dollars that is presently in
a Security Company in Europe.I contacted you because it is against our
code of ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your assistance
would be needed to  claim the money in the Security Company in Europe.We
have unanimously agreed that 25% of the entire sum would be for you if
you agree to take part in this profitable transaction,70% for me and 2
of my colleagues while the remaining 5% would be used to pay back the
expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction by
both parties after the fund has been claimedand lodged in your
account.In the event that you are genuinely interested in the
transaction,the following information would be needed from you to 
expedite action. 
1) Your Full Name and Address that would be used to establish you as the
next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary
of the fund.This would ensure that the Security Company in Europe
releases the Consignment/Fund to you.

2) Your Private Mobile,Telphone and Fax numbers where you can be reached
at all time because this transaction entails constant communication.The
transaction is 100% risk free as all modalities has been perfected to
ensure the hitch free success of the transaction.If you are interested,
soend the requested information mailto:davideto6@web-mail.com.ar


I await your response urgently.

Regards,

Mr David Eto
