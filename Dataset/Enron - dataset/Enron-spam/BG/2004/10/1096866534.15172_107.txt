Niger-Delta Development Commission
No.1, NDDC Avenue, Port-Harcourt,
Rivers State, Nigeria.
Dear Sir,
I am one of the Director-General of Niger-Delta Development Commission
(NDDC),constitutionally mandated with the responsibility of managing of
Niger-Delta Development Fund for the development of the region. Niger-Del=
ta
is the south-south geographical area of Federal Republic of Nigeria. The
region is endowed with natural resources, which constitute about 95% of
our national income.

Consequently to the exploration of Oil and Gas, there has been verse
ecological and environmental pollution in this region. Rather unfortunate=
,
the region lacks most in fractural amenities. These and much more have ne=
cessitated
the establishment of Niger-Delta Development Commission, immediately afte=
r
the inception of this present democratic government in Nigeria.
 Sequel to the passing of bill by the National House of Assembly (the
legislative organ of the Government) and duly accented to by the presiden=
t,legitimizing
the operations of the Commission by an act of law. The Commission has,the=
refore,been
constitutionally empowered to implement a policy, which will relatively
address the long-standing neglect of the region. Encouraging, the commiss=
ion
having successfully inherited the fine accruing from the violation of the=

Associated Gas Injection Act of 1979, the oil companies operational in th=
e
region have also been mandated to pay 5% of their taxable profit to Niger=

Delta Development Fund, kept in (NDDC) account in Apex Bank (CBN) -
with my commission having jurisdiction over the fund.
The fund has since incurred well over hundred million dollars. The
commission having performed its duties diligently in identifying, negotia=
ting
and awarding people oriented contracts worth millions of dollars, myself
and colleagues want to have fifty million eight hundred and fifty thousan=
d
united states dollars (US$50, 850, 000.00) transferred abroad for our per=
sonal
use Consequently,we want you to assist have the fund remitted into your
account.

I assure you that the transaction is 100% risk- free and scam /money
laundry as we have concluded every arrangement to protect the interest of=

every one involved. Likewise, all modalities for the successful transfer
of this money have been worked out with the Federal Ministry of Finance
and the Apex Bank (CBN) to facilitate the remittance of this money into
your designated bank account.

However, I would want to believe that you are trustworthy/honest enough
and will not raise any misgiving attitude in any aspect of the
transaction,more importantly, you will keep this transaction very confide=
ntial
so as not to tarnish the confidence reposed on these official by the Gove=
rnment
of Nigeria.

Upon your acceptance to collaborate with us, we will front you to have
performed a contract with the commission, therefore, the beneficiary of
the fund .

Every document in respect of the contract, legitimizing you as the true
beneficiary of the fund and authorizing you its immediate remittance into=

your nominated account shall be obtained and perfected. Importantly, howe=
ver,
due to the nature of the fund and the need to have the esteemed personali=
ty
of myself and colleagues involved in this transaction protected, we have
agreed to jointly invest the fund in your economy.

Note, for your assistance you shall be compensated with 25% of the fund
while 5% is for any expense incurred during the transaction. You are
hereby required to furnish me with the following information's: (I) Your
name and address (ii) your company name and address (iii) Your private te=
lephone
and fax numbers, so that I can write letters of claim on your behalf and
forward them to our Apex Bank (CBN) for approval, who would then make con=
tact
with you and credit your account with the total amount of US$50,850,000.0=
0.

I assure you that if you will follow my instruction, the fund shall be
in your Account within 14 working days of submiting your details to the
ministries concerned, your line of business does not necessarily matter
in this transaction Your immediate response will be highly appreciated.

Best regard
Rufus Giwa
