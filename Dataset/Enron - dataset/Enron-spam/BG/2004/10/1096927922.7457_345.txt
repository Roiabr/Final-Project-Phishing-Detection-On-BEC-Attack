Sir/madam

I have a premonition that you could be trusted to assist me in
effecting a fund transfer into your nominated account. As such I
strongly believe it that
you will not sit on our fund when it finally gets into your nominated
account.

You see, we are top officials of the Federal Government Contract
Review Panel who are interested in importation of goods into our
country with funds which are presently trapped in Nigeria in order to
commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said trapped funds.

The source of this fund is as follows:- During the last regime here,
some Government officials set up companies and awarded themselves
contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various Ministries.
The present Government set up a Contract Review Panel and we have
identified a lot of inflated Contract Funds which are presently
floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for Payment.
However, by virtue of our position as civil servants and members of
the Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names. I have therefore,

been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the Panel to
look
for an Oversea partner into whose account we would transfer the sum
of US$20,500,000.00 (Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand UnitedStates

Dollars) only.

Hence we are writing you this letter, we have agreed to share the
money thus:
1) 25% for the account owner (you)
2) 70% for the Officials (us)
3) 5% will be for settling of taxation and all local and foreign
expenses. It is from the 70% that we wish to commence the said
business.

We would want you to furnish us with your full particulars such as your

Name, Telephone Numbers, Fax Numbers,Please


Best regards,
Mr adede  anthony
