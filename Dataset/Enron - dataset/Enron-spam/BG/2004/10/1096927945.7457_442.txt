Attention:

I am Mr.PAUL OKPARA, Principal Partner Benson & Associates
(EQUITY CHAMBERS). I need your urgent and very confidential
Approach to this proposition.
On January 6,1998, my client a Foreign Oil Consultant/Contractor
With the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr.
James Gibson made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve
Calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).
Upon maturity of his deposit, the chambers got a routine
notification from the Finance House which was sent to his
Forwarding address.
After a month, we got a reminder from the Finance House and I had
to verify his where about from his contract employers, the NNPC.
Unfortunately, I was informed by the NNPC that my client died
From an automobile accident about a month to the first letter
From the Finance House.
As his legal representative, I know that my client died without
Making a WILL and all my attempts to trace his next of kin has
Been fruitless.

Furthermore, as his attorney, I am aware that he did not declare
any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,
Including his Depository Form with the Finance House.
According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,
the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government
if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Since I have been unsuccessfully in locating the relatives, I
Seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of my late
Client so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$17,500,000.00
(minus incurred interest)can be paid to you.
I will expect you to use your human discretion in sharing the
Funds when it's been transferred into your custody.

I will put together all necessary legal documents that can be
Used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your
Honest cooperation to enable us sees this deal through
Particularly your words of honor not to sit on the funds when
It=E2??s in your control. Please!
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate
Arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.


Telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this
Transaction.
I wait to hear from you soon, have a nice day.
please you should reply to my private email address

Thank you.
Barrister Paul okpara
