<p>  As she spoke she touched him with her golden wand First she threw a fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders then she made him younger and of more imposing presence she gave him back his color filled out his cheeks and let his beard become dark again.
</p>

<p>  Then she went away and came back inside the hut His son was astounded when he saw him and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking upon a god  Stranger said he how suddenly you have changed from what you were a moment or two ago You are dressed differently and your color is not the same Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven If so be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings of wrought gold.
</p>

<p>  Have mercy upon me  And said I am no god why should you take me for one I am your father on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands of lawless men  As he spoke he kissed his son and a tear fell from his cheek on to the ground for he had restrained all tears till now but could not yet believe that it was his father and said  You are not my father but some god.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>  Me with vain hopes that I may grieve the more hereafter no mortal man could of himself contrive to do as you have been doing and make yourself old and young at a moment s notice unless a god were with him.
</p>

<p>What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess who does with me whatever she will for she can do what she pleases At one moment she makes me like a beggar and the next I am a young man with good clothes on my back it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.
</p>

<p>As he spoke he sat down and threw his arms about his father and wept They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half fledged young by peasants Thus piteously did they weep and the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if had not suddenly said In what ship my dear father did your crew bring you to Of what nation did they declare themselves to be for you cannot have come by land.
