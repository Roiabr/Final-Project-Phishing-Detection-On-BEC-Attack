<p>Read review by major news Network below</p>

  
  <p>&quot;Now the third product is that spray that is surprisingly effective,
  it puts a high gloss finish on your plate which causes a reflection that makes
  the plate overexposed so its practically impossible for police to spot plates
  that have been treated with the reflective spray and in many jurisdictions
  there's no specific rule that your tag must be photogenic.&quot;<br>
  <em><strong>-Michael Garjulo Fox 5 news<br>
  </strong></em></p>

  
  <p>&quot;This is a high gloss spray that even the bakersfield police
  department admits they have a hard time proving whats on your plate.&quot;</p>

  
<p><em><strong>-CBS news</strong></em></p>
<p>&quot;the product works&quot;. &quot;state law makes outlawed plate covers,
but the statute doesn't specifically address sprays&quot;</p>
<p><em><strong>-NBC</strong></em></p>
<p>&quot;at the time being Australian, authorities are powerless to stop its
use, let alone catch those who are using it.&quot;</p>
