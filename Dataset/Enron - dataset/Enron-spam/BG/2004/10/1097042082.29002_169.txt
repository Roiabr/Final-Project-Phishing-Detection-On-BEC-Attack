DEAR Friend,


I know that this letter will come to you as a surprise 

considering the fact that we have not met before.I am truly 

looking for someone that will assist me with a business that has 

to do with my family estate which my late father left behind for 

us.i am contacting you based on the fact that i want some one 

that is not known to my family to assist me in this business and 

this is for security reasons which i will explain to you as we 

make progress.
  
I am the first son of the late Joseph Desire Mobutu, the former 

President of "ZAIRE" now democratic republic of congo .
I am presently on political asylum in Nigeria . I got your 

contact over the internet during my search for a person that 

will assist me in this business.this became neccessary as i do 

not want anybody known to me or my family to be associated with 

this money.

I want you to note that this business will benefit both of us 

and that it is 100% risk free. However, you must confirm your 

ability to handle this because it involves a large amount of 

money. The funds "THIRTY SEVEN MILLION UNITED STATES 

DOLLARS"($37million)is my share of my father's estate. I boxed 

and shipped the money to a security company abroad at the peak 

of the a political uprising that rocked my country few years 

ago. Now that the crisis has ended , I need a trustworthy person 

to proceed to the place of the  security company in order to 

clear the fund and afterwards,i will come to your country for us 

to start a joint business venture as i do not have the intention 

of bringing the funds back to Africa for a very long time.Note 

that I will send to you the relevant documents that will enable 

\you take
possession of the fund for onward investment for our mutual 

benefit. 

All I need from you is as follows:

1. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this business for 

me.

2.your word that you will keep this business as confidential as 

possible at all times until we conclude this business.

3. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.

4. Your full permanent address.


As soon as I get the above information from you, I will disclose 

to you the name and the country of the security company,the 

contact of the diplomat that i have hired to assist nus in this 

business,as well as your name and particulars to the security 

company as my representative and my partner to enable them 

contact you accordingly.



 As we make progress,i will send to you a"LETTER OF AUTHORITY" 

and "AGREEMENT LETTER" to enable you clear the fund on my 

behalf. Note that this is a very safe transaction as this funds 

is my share of my father's estate.I await your response to 

enable us proceed.


Regards,


From;NZANGA MOBUTU
