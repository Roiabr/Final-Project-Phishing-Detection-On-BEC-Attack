Dear Sir,

  REQUESTING ASSISTANCE AND PARTNERSHIP.

I am Adams Femi , a Financial Consultant Adviser to Jean
Bertrand Aristide,TheFormer Haitian President based in
London{UK}.

Mr.Jean Bertrand Aristide was involved in a Political and
Economic Financial tussle in the Haitian Government which
led to his finances/accounts been probed 
and eventually frozen.

Therefore he mandated me to make foreign contacts regarding
the transfer of a hidden sum of US$40,600,000.00 (Fourty
Million Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).This
fund is unknown to the Haitian Government.


For reference,you can check the websites below:

In the light of the above,I ask for your assistance in the
transfer of this fund currently in a Security/Finance
Company in Madrid,Spain into a foreign account you may wish
to provide.

After the successful transfer of the above stated amount,20%
of the total sum will go to you for your assistance. 5% of
the total sum will be set aside to 
compensate for any incidental expenses incurred by both
parties during the course of this transaction.

More details will be given in the course of our
correspondences.

You can respond with this email address or
adams.femi@voila.fr if you are interested thereafter we can
communicate on the phone to establish mutual trust.

Your confidentiality is highly required in this matter.

Thank you for your anticipated co-operation.

Regards,
Mr.Adams Femi
