Your Honour,


This proposal may be of a surprise to you, as we have not met in any way
before. I feel you will serve as a reliable source to be used to achieve
this aim, by trusting under your care the total sum of Twenty Million Uni=
ted
States Dollars. My name is Moses Adams a National of Haiti, Solicitor at
law and the personal Attorney to late Mr. Mark Michelle a French Citizen
who used to be a private contractor with the Shell Petroleum Development
Company in Saudi Arabia.

On the 21st of April 2001 he was involved in an auto crash alongside his
wife and their three children all occupants of the vehicle unfortunately
lost their lives, since then I have made several enquiries to locate any
of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.After=

these several unsuccessful attempts I decided to contact you with this bu=
siness
partnership proposal, I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the
funds left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared un=
serviceable
by the Finance/Security Company where these deposit was lodged.

The Company has issued me a notice to provide his next of kin otherwise
have the account confiscated within this week, since I have been unsucces=
sful
in locating the relatives for over two years now. I seek your consent to
present you as the next of kin to the deceased so
that the money can be paid to you, this will be disbursed in these percen=
tages
70% to me and 30% to you.

All I require is your honest co-operation, confidentiality and trust to
enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be=

executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any br=
each
of the law.

Please get in touch with me urgently at: micahio22@yahoo.co.uk , and plea=
se
send me your direct telephone/fax numbers. Your urgent response is highly=

anticipated and will be appreciated, God almighty be with you.

Thanks.
MOSES ADAMS
