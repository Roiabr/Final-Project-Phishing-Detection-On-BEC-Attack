Dear sir
                    
I need your assistance to transfer and invest 15m. Pounds Sterlin(Fifteen=

Million Great Britain Pounds) I have the courage to ask for your assistan=
ce
to handle this important and confidential business believing that you wil=
l
never let me down either now or in future.
 I am Barrister Donald Williams A U.K National and I am the attorney to
Late Dennise Berkins a foreigner and an Engineer with Atlas Engineering
Consultancy,here in United Kingdom.
Late Dennise Berkins has an account with a Bank here in the U.K Since 199=
0.But
his untimely death was as a result of cardiac arrest which did not give
him any opportunity to make a will.
I received a memo early this Month from the Bank for an interview,
The Bank informed me on their policy to Freeze the account and redirect
the funds back to Government treasury  because they saw no next of kin or=

any "WILL" in Dennise Berkins entire file Except me, as his attorney but
not his inheritor.
After scrutinizing his entire file within my Chamber i discovered that he=

had no next of kin in his entire file with me too.
On that issue i opened up to the manager of operations of the Bank on my
intention to move the funds for investments out of the United Kingdom.
He then adviced me to look for a foreigner whom i can front because Denni=
se
Berkins is not a U.K National,so we shall require a person who is not res=
idence
in the U.K
The fund was proceeds from contract sum paid into Dennise Berkins  accoun=
t
as payment for contracts executed according to the united Kingdom financi=
al
policies.
 I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with fore=
ign
account as the foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make=

this transaction work.
All i need from you is your full name and address,to enable me start proc=
essing
the necessary required legal documents to back up your claim for the appr=
oval
of the transfer in your favour.
i will also need your telephone and fax numbers for oral communications
too when necessary.
We can sign a binding agreement between us and i will suggest we scan cop=
ies
of our international passports or drivers license as a form of security
between us.
I have resolved to share the money in this ratio.
50% for me,30% for you ,15% for the Operations manager in the Bank and 5%=

for expences we might incurre on the course of processing of this transac=
tion.
I will come over to your country for sharing and investements as soon as
you confirm the funds in your desired  account. 
The entire details of this transaction and all the role you are required
to play , i will send to you on your positive response to this mail.

Barrister, Donald Williams
