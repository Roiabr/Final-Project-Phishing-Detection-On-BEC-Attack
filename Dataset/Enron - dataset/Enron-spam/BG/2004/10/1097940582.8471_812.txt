Wall Street Oil Report<br>
Soaring Oil Issues For Immediate Profits
<p>All-time record highs for oil are padding oil company profits.<br>
  Focus your attention on ERHC - Joint Ownership of Offshore Billion <br>
  Barrel Oil Blocks with ExxonMobil, Joint Venture Agreements with <br>
  Major NYSE Oil Leaders!</p>
<p>Grab this HOT OIL PLAY with guaranteed Billion Barrel Blocks being <br>=

  awarded within days.</p>
<p>Environmental Remediation Holding Corp. OTCBB - ERHC</p>
<p>Current Price .40</p>
<p>Target for October 1.25</p>
<p>What is an oil stock worth with guaranteed preferential rights to <br>
  billions of barrels of oil in the hottest offshore zone in West <br>
  Africa? Oil prices were pushing through $40 just 5 months ago, now <br>
  the $50 barrier has been shattered. Read the headlines lately? Oil <br>
  prices are expected to continue climbing.</p>
<p>Serious attention has turned to a group of 9 offshore oil blocks in <br=
>
  West Africa where Schlumberger SLB-$69, the world leader in reservoir <b=
r>
  imaging services, has validated recoverable reserves at over 14 <br>
  Billion Barrels. This is worth Hundreds of Billions no matter what <br>
  formula is applied. This would explain why ChevronTexaco and ExxonMobil =
<br>
  paid over 120 Million to win operatorship of Block 1.</p>
<p>ERHC has very strong percentages of 6 of the remaining blocks to be <br=
>
  awarded along with ExxonMobil and 2 other NYSE super-majors that have <b=
r>
  partnered with ERHC. ERHC has signed a partnership agreement with <br>
  Pioneer Natural Resources PXD-$35 in Block 2, and Noble Energy NBL-$60 <=
br>
  in Block 4. Estimates amongst the international press covering these <br=
>
  events point to ERHC and their respective partners capturing between <br=
>
  50% and 75% of both Blocks 2 and 4. The awards for these blocks are <br>=

  expected to be finalized any day. The value of these awards in <br>
  conjunction with international press coverage is the sudden impact <br>
  needed to set ERHC shares on fire!</p>
<p>Any oil issue with events of this magnitude in today's climate is going=
 <br>
  to fly. Read the press for additional confirmation of what is at stake. =
<br>
  ERHC's rights have been exercised by the Company and are guaranteed. <br=
>
  ERHC's partnership agreements with oil super-majors are iron-clad. <br>
  Investors must act quickly to accumulate a substantial position just <br=
>
  before earth-shattering news is released that will send shockwaves <br>
  through ERHC.</p>
