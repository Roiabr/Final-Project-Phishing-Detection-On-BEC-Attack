Compliments. 

I have gotten your contact information
from Mr. Carl Barry, of Web Futures, INC., who states
to me that he is acquainted with your business ethics,
I wonder if this information is correct, but if it is,
then I would like to introduce you to some financial
issues he and I have been involved in over the past
couple of months. The issues involve some funds that
need to be invested, but between him, the brokers and
the owners of the investment fund, we were unable to
complete the investing of the fund due to the
following reasons:

1. The said fund amounts to Twenty Five Million
Dollars (US&#41;.

2. The said fund is in cash and needs to be
transferred in the same state, due to restrictive
banking laws in the territory where the fund is
presently secured in cash. The banking laws do not
permit deposit of an amount in excess of Ten Thousand
Dollars so there is not way that the fund can be
banked.

3. The fund could be invested through your agency in
the purchase of facility and assets for investment
purposes within your country, in collaboration with
the agency of the current brokers.

4. This transaction could result in your being paid a
commission of 10% off the investment capital.

5. The fund owners desire absolute confidentiality and
professionalism in the handling of this matter, due to
risks of seizure of the fund and litigation if
personality is revealed.

And:

The fund owners have interest to invest in any of the
following industries, depending on which is most not
transparent, low risk, and average profit yielding-
Power Generation, Telecommunication and Software
Development, Hardware Manufacturing and Export,
Construction or Real-Estate Development.

Based upon the information provided above, I would
like to know if you shall be able to assist in the
nature of managing the investment fund. You must note
that the fund can only be transferred in cash,
therefore if you are in acceptance to participate with
us in the investment of the fund, you shall also need
to participate with us in the transfer of the fund in
cash in the manner of receiving the fund in cash and
depositing it in a Trust account opened in favour of
the investment to be established. And this account
would serve as the base or operating account for the
investment.

I am obliged to believe that you would be able to
understand the information above, and should you need
further information, please do not hesitate to ask.

Kindly confirm receipt of this email.

Sincerely.

Quazi Hossain.
