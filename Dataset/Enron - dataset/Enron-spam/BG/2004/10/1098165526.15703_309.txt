MR. WANG QIN
HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONG KONG.
EMAIL: wng_qn@yahoo.com 

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin,
credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a
concealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S
and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who
was with the Iraqi forces and also a business man made
a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with
a value of Twenty Six Million Five Hundred Thousand
United State Dollars (US$26,500.000.00) only in my
branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to
him, even during the war early this year. Again after
the war another notification was sent and still no
response came from him. We later find out that the
General and his family had been killed during the war
in a bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered
that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of
kin in his official papers including the paper work of
his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of
his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Six Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying
in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim
it. What bothers me most is that according to the to
the laws of my country, at the expiration of three
years the funds will revert to the ownership of the
Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is
that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the
next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be
able to receive his funds. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned
out so that we shall come out successful. I have
contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary
documents that will back you up as the next of kin to
Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at
this stage is for you to provide me with your Full
Names and Address so that the attorney can commence
his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the
attorney will also file for claims on your behalf and
secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in
your favor for the movement of the funds. There is no
risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to
adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare
all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to
observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning
this issue.

Once the funds have been transferred, we shall share
in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any
expenses incurred during the course of this operation.
Should you be interested, please contact me via email
as I am not fluent in English and I would like all
communication to be via email. 

As soon as I get your response, I will provide you
with more details of this operation. Your earliest
response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards

Mr. Wang Qin
