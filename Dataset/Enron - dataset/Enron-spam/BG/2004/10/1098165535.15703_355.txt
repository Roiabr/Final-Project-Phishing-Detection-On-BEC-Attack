Presently the funds can also be paid out by South Africa's offshore bank in England=2E

Like I stated earlier on=2C this funds emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which my husband's company executed with the Government of South Africa=2EI am afraid
 that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1995 to date=2E If they discover this money yet unclaimed with my husband's name 
linked to it=2C the government will confiscate the money and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definitely affect my political career in Government=2E

I want your assistance to front as a co-owner of his company =28Tshabalala Construction=2C LTD=29 to facilitate the release of the funds=2E I will introduce a very good attorney to 
assist us with the transfer process without any hitch but he will not be told my interest in the transaction as I play a very sensitive role in my government=2E As the contract was 
executed in my present government department=2C be rest assured that I will use my position to approve the immediate release of the entitlement=2E As soon as the funds are 
release in your favour=2C you are expected to move it immediately into your personal bank account in your country=2E Please once you have confirmed receipt of the funds into 
your account=2C I want you to notify me immidiately=2C so that I will arrange to meet with you=2E

The lawyer I will recommend to assist us will be representing our interest at the Reserve Bank of South Africa and all necessary quarters=2E All future correspondence must be 
made either to the attorney or myself=2E

Please=2C I want you to note here that I am reposing huge trust on you regardless of your being a total stranger=3B please=2Clets make brotherhood and sincerity our watchword=2E 
Upon your reply=2C we shall discuss your percentage for your assistance=2E
