Dear: Sir/Ma,

It is my pleasure to contact you for assistance and business 
co-operation. 

I know the content of this letter might be surprising to you. But I 
assure you that every word of it is true. Even though we hardly know each=

other I believe you can help me. 

I am DR. OBA KOSOKO, The President of a special task force in charge of
the sales of petroleum products in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Wes=
t

Africa. My office monitors the sales and lifting of crude oil and 
petroleum product by foreign dealers. With the cooperation of my 
assistant and head of the audit committee attached to the task force,I ha=
ve
successfully saved about $38.6 million US Dollars. 

This money is as a result of allocation of excess crude oil to the 
foreign dealers, which has been sold but which money is not entered in th=
e
financial statement of my task force. 

This money is now lying unclaimed in the account of the task force, know
only to my partners and me involved in the excess allocation. 

However, the legislators of the new democratic government of my country
have set up a panel to look into the past activities of some government
companies and parastatals. We do not want the panel to discover the money=

we saved. 

I cannot lodge this money into our private bank account. 
In my country, public servants are not permitted to operate any account
in excess of $500,000 U. S Dollars. Now the idea is to have a foreign par=
tner
whom the sum will be transferred to. We have concluded arrangement to tra=
nsfer
this money to your private bank account.if you permit us to use it. 

All you have to do is to send me your private address, phone and fax line=
s
and banking particulars I will send you the details of the 
transfer and necessary document as soon as you provide them. 

If you can assist us transfer this money out before the panel starts 
work, we will give 30% of the amount for your assistance needed in this
transaction. You will keep the remaining sum for us pending our arrival
to your country. 

I intend to invest 50% of the sum in business with your knowledge and pas=
t
experience your advice will be highly needed for the investment. 

I would want to know the lucrative business areas in your country we can
invest on with the 50% of the sum. Don't worry about any problem in this
business. I assure it is safe and no risk is involved. 

No other party is aware of the sum from the excess allocation except my
partner and me. However, this transaction should be secret and confidenti=
al.


I await your quick reply on this transaction.  For any further informatio=
n,
you can always reach me through my alternative email:  dr_obakosoko022@ya=
hoo.co.uk


Regards, 

DR. OBA KOSOKO
