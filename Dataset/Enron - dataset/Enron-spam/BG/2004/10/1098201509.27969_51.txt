Greetings,

I crave your indulgence as I contact you in such a surprising manner. But I 
respectfully insist you read this letter carefully as I am optimistic it will 
open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both of us. This business 
transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of your business 
activities, but I plead your assistance, as your flair for profitable business 
is needed.

Permit me to introduce myself, I am Mr. Eric Manuel a consultant. I am writing 
this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business 
opportunity in my department.

A foreigner who also happens to be a client of mine who before her deasth, was 
an Oil Merchant/Contractor, until her death last year as result of a HEART 
ATTACK  had a closing balance of US9,500,000.00(Nine Million,Five Hundred 
Thousand Dollars). Ever since her death and up till this time of writing, no 
next-of-kin or relation of her's that I am aware of has come forward to claim 
her money deposited with a Financial institution..

Fervent valuable efforts have been made by the Fiduciary Company and myself to 
get in touch with any of her immediate family member or relatives but proved to 
no avail. Naturally, as long as her  money remains unclaimed, this Financial 
institution remains richer in free funds with her money. However, with my 
position, I can present you to claim the fund as a relative/next of kin if you 
agree with me on private basis. Yes, I can present you.

The request for you as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact 
that my client was a foreigner, and I personally cannot stand as next of kin to 
a foreigner, Hence, I plead for your assistance with the intention of getting 
this unclaimed money amounting to US9,500,000.00 (Nine Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand Dollars Only transferred into a company/private bank account that you 
will present.

You stand to gain a negotiable percentage of the fund if you agree to help me 
actualize this opportunity; I will not contact any other company or person 
until I am convinced that you are not interested in this proposal. Contact me 
immediately indicating your willingness and also give your direct and 
confidential fax and phone numbers for the effective communication that this 
transaction requires.  I will furnish you with the procedure and also enlighten 
you on how the funds will be disbursed and shared on receipt of your response. 
I will also require your advice in the areas of investment as I plan to 
establish a business venture in your country with my share. PLEASE FORWARD YOUR 
RESPONSE TO MY ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ACCOUNT: em1@kannalles.com.

I look forward to your earliest reply. Remember that a business of this nature 
needs to be kept confidential.

Yours Sincerely,
Mr. Eric Manuel
