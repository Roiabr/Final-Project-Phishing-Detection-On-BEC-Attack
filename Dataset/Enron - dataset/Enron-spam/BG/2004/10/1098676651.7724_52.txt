Dear Friend,
I, on behalf of my colleagues from different Federal 
Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to 
solicit your assistance as regards transfer of 
US$10,500,000.00 (Ten Million,five Hundred Thousand US 
Dollars) into your bank account.
These funds emanated from unclaimed contractual 
proceeds of foreign contracting firms who could not 
meet their financial obligations to their 
creditors.
We,as holders of sensitive positions in our 
various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal 
Government to scrutinise all payments made to certain 
foreign contractors and we discovered that some of the 
contractors have not been paid their contractual 
entitlement which collectively left the sum of 
US$15,500,000.00 (Fiftheen Million, five Hundred 
Thousand US Dollars) lying in a suspended 
Account.
However, from our investigations, we discovered that 
the foreign beneficiary companies have since been 
liquidated, and to all intents and purposes no longer 
exist in Nigeria, thus providing us with this 
opportunity, provided that we have a capable partner, 
to execute a transaction of this nature.
We agreed that the said amount would be transferred 
into an overseas Bank Account to be provided by a 
reliable foreign firm/associate. This is because as 
serving Government workers the Civil Service Code does 
not allow us to operate foreign Account. In our initial 
attempt to do this, we succeeded in transferring part 
of this amount US$5m (Five Million Dollars) into a 
United States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but 
our foreign associate failed to honour our mutual 
agreement insisting instead that the total amount be 
transferred into the Account before we can share the 
money.
As a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of 
our Lebanese partner to see this matter to its logical 
conclusion, and until the initial transaction is 
satisfactorily resolved, we have cancelled further 
transactions with him. In the light of the foregoing, 
it is clear that we require a partner that is not only 
capable of rendering assistance and cooperation in 
executing this matter, but will honour the terms of 
agreement when we reach the concluding
stages of this transaction.
We therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sum 
in return for services/assistance rendered in 
successfully carrying out this project. We trust that 
you appreciate the sensitive nature of this matter and 
the need for initial caution on our part, but when a 
relationship is confidently established and operations 
commence you will be provided with all relevant 
information.
I remain at your disposal to entertain any 
questions/enquiries relating to this proposition and 
you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-mail, 
for further information on the procedures and 
requirements of this transaction.
In your reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone 
number where I can always reach you. Hope to hear from 
you soon. Please treat with the strictest 
confidentiality and expediency.

Yours faithfully,

Kola Simon
