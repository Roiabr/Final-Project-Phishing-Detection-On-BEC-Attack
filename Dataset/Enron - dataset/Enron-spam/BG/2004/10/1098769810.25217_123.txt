Due to concerns, for the safety and integrity of the online banking commun=

firmed due to inactive customers, fraud and spoof reports. If you could pl=
ease take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and renew your record=
s you will not run into any future problems with the online service. Howev=
er, failure to confirm your records may result in your account suspension.=

<br><br>
Once you have confirmed your account records your internet banking service=
 will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.
