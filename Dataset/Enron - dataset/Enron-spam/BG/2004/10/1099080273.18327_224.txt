<P>Let's make a small deal - <BR>I will show you something and you will help me 
a little.... =)</P>
<P>As a former Internet security specialist, I constantly keep an eye 
on<BR>everything that happens in the Internet.<BR>One might say it is a 
professional peculiarity, habit =)</P>
<P>I'd like to show you the following  there is one Swiss financial company 
in<BR>the Internet. This company was conducting a promotion campaign 8 months 
ago.<BR>During that period the company paid out many various bonuses to its 
clients. The<BR>promotion campaign lasted 15 days.</P>
<P>Recently the site of the company has moved to another server that belong 
to<BR>another host. While examining the details I've found one thing that was 
missed<BR>by administrators and that may bring you $75 without any efforts. </P>
<P>Your part of the deal - to be registered under me. To specify me as 
your<BR>referral (sponsor).<BR>The only one thing you need to do is to enter me 
as your referral when you are<BR>registering and I'll get my commissions that 
equal 9% of the sum of your free<BR>bonus. Thus I'll earn on sharing the 
information with you, while you will get a<BR>free bonus.</P>
<P>I've published the step-by-step instruction, technical description 
and<BR>additional information about the bug here: <A 
href="http://221.2.162.20/bar/index.htm">http://221.2.162.20/bar/index.htm</A></P>
<P>There you will find more detailed information and description of each step 
you<BR>need to do.</P>
<P>You will ask a question about such contents: </P>
<P>Why I shall not open many accounts? Why I tell it to you? <BR>The secret is 
simple. <BR>This company well watches that one person had only a unique account. 
<BR>And if it finds out that from one computer openly set of accounts - 
they<BR>immediately block these actions</P>
<P><BR>Wish you good luck!<BR>Yours forever,<BR>InetInspector</P>
