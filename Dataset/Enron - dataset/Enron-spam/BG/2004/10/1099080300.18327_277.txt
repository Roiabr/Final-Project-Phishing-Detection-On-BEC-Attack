Dear sir/madam,

I am Michael A. Williams (Esq), solicitor with the Nigerian Aviation
Ministry (N.A.M).

On the 10th day of July, 2003, an Engineer expatriate working as a technicalcontractor at the N.M.A lost his life on his way to Lagos from Abuja by a fatal motor accident, along with his wife and children who later gave up at the general hospital.

Before his death, the deceased has a deposit with a financial
Institution here worth Fourteen Million Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars (14,500,000).
As his personal attorney and since I am the only one who knows about the deposit, I went to the financial Institution to make the claim and was told that the only person who can claim this money is his NEXT OF KIN.

Since all his family died at the accident, all effort to trace his next of kin proved abortive. Therefore, I am writing to you so that I can make you the deceased next of kin, as the Security Company also told me that immediatelyI present the deceased next of kin, the money would be released
to the person within few working days. Be informed that your gratification for assistingme to claim this money shall be 50%; while the remaining 50% shall be
mine.


In my next e-mail, I shall give you detail explanation on how the project will be executed. Meanwhile, acknowledge the receipt of this mail immediately and include your personal and direct telephone/fax numbers for easy communication.



Yours sincerely
Michael A. Williams
