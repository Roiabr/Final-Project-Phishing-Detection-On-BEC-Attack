Dear Sir,
I am Barrister Fidelis Ogom, Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to 
Mr Mark cruise a national of your country, who used to work with shell development

company in Nigeria. On the 21st of April 1999, my client,his wife And their
three 
children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu/Lagos Express Road.unfortunately
they All lost their lives in the event of the accident, Since then I have
made 
several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of in my clients extended

relatives, this has also proved unsu ccessful.After these several unsuccessful
attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any
member of his family but to 
no avail,
.
I contact you to assist me in receiving the money and property left behind
by my
client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank
where
this huge deposits lodged.Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had
an account valued at about $9 million dollars. Conseqently,
The bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the 
account confiscated within the next ten official working days. since i have

been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 3 years now I seek

your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you
are from the same country so that the proceeds of this account valued at
$9 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money.
60% to me and 30% to you,while 10%
should be for expenses or tax as your government may require.
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any 
claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us
see 
this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate

arrangement that will protect y  ! ou from any breach of the law.
Please get in touch with me by my email to enable us discuss further
Best regards,

Barrister  Fidelis Ogom,
