Joke Of The Day

Did you hear about the blonde that tried to blow up her husband's car? 
She burned her lips on the tailpipe! 

Q: Why was the blonde disappointed with her trip to England? 
A: She found out Big Ben was only a clock. 

What's the difference between a smart blonde and Bigfoot? 
Maybe someday we'll find Bigfoot. 

A blond guy and a brunette girl were happily married and about to have a baby. One day, the wife started having contractions, so the husband rushed her to the hospital. He held her hand as she went through a trying birth. In the end, there were two little baby boys.
The blond guy turned to his wife and angrily said, "All right, who's the other father!?!" 

Q: Why did the blond quit his restroom attendant job? 
A: He couldn't figure out how to refill the hand dryer! 

A blonde co-ed is looking at a bulletin board and she sees a piece of paper that says, ''Ocean Cruise Only 5$.'' She pulls the piece of paper off the wall and goes to the address listed on the back of paper. She walks into the building and hands the secretary the piece of paper. The secretary nods and asks if she had the five dollars. The blonde pulls five dollars out of her pocket and hands it to the secretary. The secretary looks over to a burly guy reading a newspaper. She nods to the him. He stands up and knocks the blonde unconscious. When the blonde wakes up she''s tied to a log and is floating down river. She starts to think that this was a bad idea. When she sees one of her freinds (who is also blonde) tied to a log floating right next to her, she says, "So do you think they''re going to serve us some food on this trip?"
