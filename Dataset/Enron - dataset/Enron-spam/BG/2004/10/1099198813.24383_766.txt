When asked to explain his favourite type of music, Luca responds, &quot;Any music that gives me emotions and feelings&hellip;..for me, music is an art-form. I play from deep to dirty sexy tribal house into progressive.&quot;<br>
        <br>

            Luca Ricci is a talent to be watched. His sound and style make him a favourite anywhere he plays. His music has taken clubbers on a voyage - connecting their minds to<br>
