		<p><strong>SunnComm has single-handedly amassed more "firsts" in the audio copy control space than any other firm in the industry. Even more impressive is the fact that these pioneering achievements have been accomplished with only a fraction of the investment capital consumed by the Company's closest competitors. In March of 2001, the first copy controlled audio CD released in the U.S. market employed SunnComm’s copy management technology. The features offered within the Company’s copy management technology have set precedents among its competitors and are fast becoming industry standards. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The Company's ability to consistently be first to market with solutions that work both technically and from a business standpoint, is a direct result of its success in developing unique and dynamic working relationships with its technology partners and customer base. These relationships have positioned the Company in such a way that facilitates an exchange of knowledge between customers, such as BMG Music and the Company’s development team. This exchange of knowledge has allowed customers to become active participants in the development process and enabled them to communicate specific product needs. In turn, this process allows the Company to design technology solutions that are both effective and capable of adaptability within a continuously evolving industry.</strong></p> 

<p><strong>SunnComm's founders recognized early on that, in order to reduce illicit copying, artists, record companies and distributors must offer consumers something superior to what they can easily use the Internet to obtain illegally. The Company also chose to offer enhanced and bonus content on its copy managed discs in order to give consumers an added incentive to comply with the wishes of copyright holders.</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>SunComm International (OTC: SCMI) has the recipe for success:</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>SunnComm Technologies' top priority has always been:</strong></p>

<p><strong>"... To develop entertainment technology that guards the content ownership rights of publishers, artists, and record companies without getting in the way of the listening experience."</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our MediaMax TM CD-3 suite of products was designed in direct response to input from the world’s largest record companies, and is the culmination of 3 years’ work.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Until MediaMax CD-3 was introduced and tested in the last quarter of 2002, no other available content protection enhancement technology product has been accepted by both the record industry and the CD consumer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MediaMax CD3 is always evolving. Sunncomm's MediaMax V.1.5 (and soon, Version 2) will allow a legitimate CD buyer the ability to enjoy the company's PLAY-MOVE-MAKETM experience.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our goal here at SunnComm Technologies is to achieve the important balance between copyright protection for content providers, and value consumers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>INDUSTRY QUOTES:</strong></p>

<p><strong>"Playability is our No. 1 concern," said Nathaniel Brown, a spokesman for BMG, a record-label owned by Bertelsmann AG. "At the moment, SunnComm is ahead of the curve in terms of playability."</strong></p>

<p><strong>Wall Street Journal:  SunnComm now stands alone within its industry. A substantial competitive advantage over Macrovision (NasdaqNM:MVSN) </strong></p>

    	<td valign="top"><font color="34422C" size="2" face="Verdana, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
		<p><strong>From a leverage standpoint, if there are two main competitors where one stock is trading at $27.00 per share (NasdaqNM:MVSN) and the other is (OTC:SCMI ) trading at only 07 cents ( A FRACTION OF ITS VALUE), which one would you bet on to go ten times your investment?</strong></p>

<p><strong>IN OUR OPINION IT WOULD BE NO CONTEST, IN FACT WHAT IS THERE EVEN TO THINK ABOUT!!!!!!! It would be much easier for SunnComm (OTC:SCMI) to hit $1.00 per share, THAT’S TEN TIMES OF ITS CURRENT TRADING PRICE.</strong></p> 

<p><strong>To achieve the same rate of return (MVSN) would have to hit $200.00.  If both companies have an equal shot, the choice is certainly a no-brainer in our mind.</strong></p>

<p><strong>SCMI is currently trading off of a 52 week low, where MVSN is trading at approximately a two percent less then its 52 week high. LOOK FOR A DEAD CAT BOUNCE ON (OTC: SCMI).</strong></p>
