Recently,my doctor told me that I have only six months
to live due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me
most is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I decided to entrust this fund to either a phylantropic organization or devoted individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instructs herein.30%of the  $15.5million goes to the individual as entitlement,
I want this individual to use 60% of this money in all sincerity to fund phylanthropic organisation, orphanages,
widowsand 10%be sent back to me to abset my medical bills and for my upkeep before i meet my creator .I am taking this decision because I don't have any child  or devoted relations that will inherit this money  I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an Ungodly manner.Hence the reasons for this bold decision. my health is Retrogressing by the minute, you will have to send your contact phone number and details about yourself,so that i will forward them to the Security Company As soon as I receive your reply to my mail address:mrsaishaabiddd@sify.com
