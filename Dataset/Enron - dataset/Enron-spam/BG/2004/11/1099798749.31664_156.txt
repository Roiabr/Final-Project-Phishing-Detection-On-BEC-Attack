As the Pope comes walking by he leans over and says something to the bum
and then walks right by the local man. He can't believe it, then it hits
him. The Pope won't talk to him, he's concerned for the unfortunate people:
the poor and and feeble ones.
Thinking fast, he gives the bum #20 to trade clothes with him. He puts on
the bum's clothing and runs down the street to line up for another chance
for the Pope to stop and talk to him. Sure enough, the Pope walks right vp
to him this time, leans over close and says "I thought I told you to get the
hell out of here!"

Two weeks later, the blonde returns, repays the #5,000 and
theinterest,which comes to#15.41. Theloan officersays,  Mis s, weare
veryhappyto havehad yourbusiness, and this transactionhas workedoutvery
nicely, butweare a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out
and found that you are a multimiloaire. What puzzles us is, why would you
bother to borrow #5,000?  The blond replies...................... Where else
in New York City can I park my car for two weeks foro nly #15.41 and expect
it to be there when I return?  Finally, a smart blonde.
There was a married blonde who was very concerned about her stupidity
