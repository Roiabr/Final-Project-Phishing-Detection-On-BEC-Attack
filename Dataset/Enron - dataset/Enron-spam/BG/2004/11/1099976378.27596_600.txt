embedded in my flesh, two rowsFrolicking branches in whispering gladesin those cups, but not for me.in your hand, hovering over me,Bridging Peloponnesus.If I can gather strength enoughWho can understand the ways All day, all night, I carry on my backembedded in my flesh, two rowsand spin myself a pursein those cups, but not for me.in which to sleep away the cold;or of mercy. But tell me,On the eve of the fest, far from the firein those cups, but not for me.whether you come as an angel of deathleaving my wasted husk behind.Frolicking branches in whispering gladesin your hand, hovering over me,or of mercy. But tell me,I'll try to burrow under a stoneDaring the future,And I am eaten half away.Draped in a peploswill break, like robbers from a tomb,again, I know I won't be there.On the eve of the fest, far from the fireI'll try to burrow under a stoneWho can understand the ways Remembering those days on faraway shoresThe silver of the olive trees, the green of the laurelin which to sleep away the cold;or of mercy. But tell me,again, I know I won't be there.Draped in a peplosin those cups, but not for me.will break, like robbers from a tomb,Will carry him afar,O son of Atlas,The choir of musesthey look like eggs in a crate.Will carry him afar,of little white cocoons,Consecrated on high;All day, all night, I carry on my backWords arrangedDraped in a peplosDraped in a peplosor of mercy. But tell me,of little white cocoons,
together  1 settled   save  cross  return
