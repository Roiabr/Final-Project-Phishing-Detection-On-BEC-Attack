TRI-STATE CAPITAL Proudly presents HeartSTAT Technology, Inc (OTC: HSTA.pk)<br>
<br>
With HeartSTAT's new revolutionary technology and great multiple-market potential, a strong patent position and proprietary systems that involved a decade of R&amp;D, HeartStat plans extraordinary financial performance while moving healthcare well into the 21st century. &nbsp;We believe -- HeartStat is poised for a tremendouse growth as the market for its product is increasing to $2.1 billion. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Revenues of $200 million are projected, representing a 10% market share. &nbsp; Management believes exit opportunities will exist within three years that should yield an ROI well in excess of 35% annually.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
What is HeartSTAT? &nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It’s a monitor that slips on the patient’s arm and measures:<br>
<br>
1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate on a continuous basis.<br>
<br>
2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How much blood the heart pumps i.e. blood flow.<br>
<br>
HS’s continuous blood pressure monitor is already FDA approved. &nbsp;The blood flow monitor uses similar non-invasive technology and will easily pass through FDA clearance. &nbsp;Remember, using this device is as simple as sticking a band aid on a patient’s arm<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &nbsp;<br>
What is the Future of HeartSTAT?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
HeartSTAT will revolutionist routine OR, ICU and ER care. &nbsp;Ultimately it will be in every place that patients are assessed including e.g. local doctors’ offices and ambulances. &nbsp;It will provide complex, essential data in a simpler manner than routine BP cuffs tell us blood pressure readings now. &nbsp;And in the not too distant future it will allow optimizations of millions of patients on e.g. heart drugs, over the Internet. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
“HeartSTAT represents a true revolution in health care and will rapidly become the standard of care.”<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
What is the Need for HeartSTAT:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One of the most difficult things in medicine is to decide who’s sick and who’s not. &nbsp;As of now there is no simple way to do this. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Even super trained specialists, such as critical care doctors or anesthetists, find it difficult to recognize when a patient is going down the tube. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The traditional “eyeballing” the patient plus the classic four vital signs and blood oxygen levels don’t cut it. &nbsp;They tell too little too late. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Prevention is always better than cure. &nbsp;This is what HeartSTAT will do. &nbsp;It allows us to treat patients before they become catastrophically ill. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The key is blood flow; blood flow within the patient’s body. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Currently the methods to achieve this are costly, complicated to perform, with potentially lethal complications and can only be done by highly trained experts. <br>
<br>
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is estimated that only five percent of patients that need monitoring can have it because of costs and the inherent risks. <br>
<br>
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What’s desperately needed is a simple non-invasive device that measures blood flow. &nbsp;This is the Holy Grail of modern medicine. &nbsp;And this is HeartSTAT.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Overview<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
HeartSTAT Technology, Inc. (“HeartSTAT “) developed and is bringing to market the first practical system for monitoring blood flow perfusion (oxygen transport) and important heart dynamics. &nbsp;It is noninvasive, continuous, and uses a simple comfortable disposable sensor. &nbsp;This addresses key issues of hospital critical care.<br>
<br>
· &nbsp; &nbsp; Blood pressure (BP) and pulse oximeter (POX) devices are the means of preventive monitoring and managing cardiovascular disease. &nbsp;However, these are commonly misleading and slow to reflect abnormality, often until it is too late.<br>
<br>
· &nbsp; &nbsp; Present cardiac output measurement is restricted to the most critical procedures on about only 5% of patients because of risks and costs.<br>
<br>
· &nbsp; &nbsp;Blood flow and perfusion are early and more specific indications for managing vital patient risks; yet this monitoring has not been practical.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
