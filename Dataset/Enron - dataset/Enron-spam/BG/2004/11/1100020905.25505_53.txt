Compliments of the day,

It is my humble pleasure to write this letter irrespective of the fact 
that you do not know me. However, I came to know of you in my 
private search for a reliable and trustworthy person that can 
handle a confidential transaction of this nature. Though, I know 
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be 
well at the end of the day.

Let me start by first, introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr. 
JOSEPH WILLIAM, a former Manager in a prime bank in Europe.

A foreigner, Late Barry Kelly, until his death Ten years ago in a 
ghastly air crash, banked with us as a client of my erstwhile 
bank. He had a closing balance of USD$10.5M (Ten
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which the 
bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his 
available foreign next of kin. Fervent valuable efforts made by 
the bank to get in touch with any of late Barry Kelly's next of kin 
(he had no known wife and children) has been unsuccessful. The 
management, in the event no one comes forth for the fund shall 
declare the fund as unclaimed and eventually "UNCLAIMABLE " 
In order to avert this negative development. Myself and some of 
my former trusted colleagues in the bank, now seek for your 
permission to have you stand as late Barry Kelly's next of kin. So 
that the fund (USD$10.5M), would be subsequently transferred 
and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin 
through our overseas corresponding bank.

All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been 
carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free 
involvement. Your share would be 10% of the total amount. While 
the rest would be for my colleagues and I, which we plan for 
purchase of properties and other profitable ventures in your 
Country.

If this proposal is OK by you, then kindly get back to me 
immediately via my above email or fax furnishing me with your 
most confidential telephone, fax and e-mail, so I can forward to 
you the relevant details of this transaction.

I look forward to your anticipated cooperation.


Best Regards,
JOSEPH WILLIAM.
