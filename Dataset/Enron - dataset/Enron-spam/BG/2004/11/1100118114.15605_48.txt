Dear Friend,

I hope this meets you in good health. My name is Jonah Baker Esq. a legal
practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane
crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You may follow the Link below to
read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life:

http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml & 

http://news.1chinastar.com/ll/english/61934.shtml

My late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Russian Contractor
in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of
Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twelve Million, Two
Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($12,200,000.00USD) in his domiciliary
bank account in a commercial bank here in South Africa Which is one of the
main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin. I have
employed every method to locate any of my clients extended relatives but
this exercise has proved unsuccessful.

After the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to
provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of
directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his
next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank
as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the
property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given
to me.

Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your contact,
while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of my
client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to act in
locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact
you with these facts before me because of the status quo. By virtue of my
brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's
financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country.

I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to
present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole
beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his
bank account, hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as
the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The
rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into
your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and
40% to you, while 10% should be for Expenses or Taxes as your Government may
require, I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be
used to back up our claim. 

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that
will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me via my 
personal email address:jonah_baker@post.cz

Best Regards,

Jonah Baker (Esq).
