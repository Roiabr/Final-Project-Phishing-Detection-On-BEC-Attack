          RE:  TRANSFER OF (US$35.5m}
Your Honour;
 I want to transfer to overseas (US$35.5m}
First, I must solicit your confidence in this
transaction, this is by virtue of it's nature as being
utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET.
 Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day.We have decided to contact you through your box
due to the urgency of this transaction.Let me start by
first introducing myself properly to you. 
I am Mr David Thompson, the Auditor General of a bank
in Africa I came to know of you in my private search
for a reliable and reputable person to handle this
confidential business which require maximum
confidence.
 THE PROPOSITION:A foreigner, Late JOHN PULE, an Oil
Merchant/Contractor with the federal Government of
Nigeria, until his death\on board the American Flight
587, an Airbus A300 left JFK, bound for Dominican
Republic that crashed in Queens New York, USA. Banked
with us here and had a balance of(US$35.5m}which the
bank now expects a next of kin to claim as
beneficiary,
Valuable efforts are being made in my bank to get in
touch with any of the Pule's family or relatives but
to no success.
It is because of the perceived possibility of not
being able to locate any of Late Engr, John Pule next
of kin {he had no wife nor children that is known to
us}. The management under the influence of I and
members of the Board of Directors,are making
arrangement for the funds to be declared.
 I am only contacting you as a foreigner because  this
money can only be approved to a foreigner or into
foregner account.I need your full co- operation to
make this work fine as i will use my office to see
that the transaction is hitch free and On the
conclusion of this business ,you will be given 25%of
the total amount ,70%will be for me ,while 5% will be
for expenses both parties might have incured during
the process of this transaction.Please send your
private telephone numbers as a need may arise 
either to call you in the day or night as occasion
warrants.All documents and proves to enable you get
this fund will be carefully worked out. We have
secured from the probate an order of mandamus to
locate any of deceased beneficiary and more so we are
assuring you this business is 100% risk free
involvement.Your share stays while the rest would be
for myself and my colleagues for investment purposes.
According to agreement within both parties.I look
forward to your earliest reply through my private
e-mail account; dauditorog2@yahoo.com  Or
davidthompsondt01@BankersMail.com 
regards
David thompson.{Auditor general}
