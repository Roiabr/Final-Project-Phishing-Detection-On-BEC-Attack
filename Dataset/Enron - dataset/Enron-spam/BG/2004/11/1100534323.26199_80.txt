Dearest Belove
 
My name is Mrs.Gloria Heinz from Germany. I am married To Mr.Robert Heinz=

who worked with the German embassy in Saudi Arabia for nine years before
he died in the year 2001. We were married for eleven years without a chil=
d.
 
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four Days. Before his
death we were both born again Christians. When my late husband was alive
he deposited the sum of US$13.5Million (thirteen Million,five hundred tho=
usand
U.S. Dollars) with a Security Company In Spain.Presently, this Money is
still With the Security Company.
 
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next six months=

due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
 
Having known my Condition I decided to donate this funds to church or Bet=
ter
still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am go=
ing
to instruct herein. I want a someone that will use these funds-to-fund 
churches,Orphanages,Research centers and widows propagating the Word of
God and to ensure that the house of God is Maintained.
 
As it is written,"that they do good,that they be rich in good works,ready=

to distribute,willing to communicates. 
 
Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to
come that they may lay hold on enternal life".{1Timothy6:18&19}.
 
I took this decision because I don't have any child that Will inherit thi=
s
Money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my Hus=
bands
hard earned money to be misused by Unbelievers. I don't want a Situation
where this money will be used in an ungodly Manner.
 
Hence the Reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death
hence I know where I am going.For to live is christ and to die is gain.
I know that I am going to be in the Bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 sa=
ys
that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my please.
 
I Don't need any telephone Communication in this regard because of my hea=
lth,and
because of the presence of my husbands relatives around Me always.I don't=

want them to know about this evelopment.As it is written; take heed that
you do not your alms before men,to be seen of them;otherwise you have no
reward of your father which is in heaven.{Mathew 6:1}. 
 
As soon As I  receive your reply I shall give you the contacts of The Fin=
ance/Security
Company in Spain.
 
I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower You as the
new beneficiary of this funds.I want you and the church to always pray fo=
r
me that it may please the eternal father for me to partake in his everlas=
ting
kingdom through Jesus Christ our lord.
 
Any delay in your Reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Chr=
istian
individual for this same purpose.
 
Please Assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated Here in. 

Hoping to hear from you soon .
 
You can as well send mail to me either through this mail or my alternativ=
e
email as stated (gloriah1780@latinmail.com) I pray for your understanding=
.
  
God Bless You.

Yours in Christ,

Mrs.Gloria Heinz.
