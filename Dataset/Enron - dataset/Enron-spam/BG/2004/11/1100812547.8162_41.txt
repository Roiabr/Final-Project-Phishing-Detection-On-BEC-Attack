t got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discover=
ed from his contract employers, the Liberian Mining Corporation that Mr. =
Ron Williams died from an automobi=0D=0Ale accident. On further investiga=
tion, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to =
trace his next of kin were fruitless.=0D=0A=0D=0A=0D=0AI therefore made f=
urther investigation and discovered that Mr. Ron Williams did not declare=
 any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including hi=
s Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$14,200,000.00 is stil=
l sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the princ=
ipal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim =
it.=0D=0A=0D=0AI and two other top managers in the Accounts and Auditing =
department had to use our position to move this funds to our off-shore fi=
nance company in Europe,and we had all documents prepared as if one of Mr=
 Ron Cousin had finally come forward for the claims and has instructed th=
at the funds be transfered to Europe as he would not be able to travel do=
wn to Liberia for the claim due to his health problem,and we had to use t=
his means to transfer this funds,and now the funds has sucessfully arrive=
