MR. WANG QIN
HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.
EMAIL: hangsengbank@tiscali.cz

I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng 
Bank Ltd.I have a concealed
business suggestion for you.
Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client General. 
Ibrahim Moussa who was
with the Iraqi forces and also business man made 
a numbered fixed deposit
for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty 
millions Five Hundred Thousand
United State Dollars only in my branch.

Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, 
even during the war early
this year. Again after the war another 
notification was sent and still no
response came from him. We later find out that 
the General and his family
had been killed during the war in bomb blast that 
hit their home.

After further investigation it was also 
discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa
did not declare any next of kin in his official 
papers including the paper
work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in 
me the last time he was
at my office that no one except me knew of his 
deposit in my bank.

So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United 
State Dollars is still
lying in my bank and no one will ever come 
forward to claim it. What bothers
me most is that according to the to the laws of 
my country at the expiration
three years the funds will revert to the 
ownership of the Hong Kong Government
if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against 
this backdrop, my suggestion
to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to 
stand as the next of kin
to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able 
to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything 
planned out so that we shall
come out successful. I have contacted an attorney 
that will prepare the
necessary document that will back you up as the 
next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim
Moussa,all that is required from you at this 
stage is for you to provide
me with your Full Names and Address so that the 
attorney can commence his
job.After you have been made the next of kin,the 
attorney will also fill
in for claims on your behalf and secure the 
necessary approval and letter
of probate in your favor for the move of the 
funds to an account that will
be provided by you.
There is no risk involved at all in the matter as 
we are going adopt a legalized
method and the attorney will prepare all the 
necessary documents. Please
endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all 
matters concerning this issue.Once
the funds have been transferred to your nominated 
bank account we shall
share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 
5% for any expenses incurred
during the course of this operation.

Should you be interested please send me your 
private phone and fax numbers
for easy communication, you can write me via my 
private box (wangqin3@echina.com)
and i will provide you with more details of this 
operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be 
appreciated.

Kind Regards
Wang Qin
