Dear Friend,

Firstly, not to cause you embarrassment, I am Barrister Werner Johnson,
a Solicitor at law and the personal attorney to late Mr. Mark Michelle
a National of France, who used to be a private contractor with the shell
Petroleum Development Company in Saudi Arabia, herein after shall be
referred to as my client. On the 21st of April 2001, he and his wife with
their
three children were involved in an auto crash; all occupants of the vehicle
unfortunately lost their lives.

Since then, I have made several enquiries with his country's embassies
to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved
unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to
contact you with this business partnership proposal. I have contacted you to
assist in repatriating a huge amount of money left behind by my client before
they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance/Security
Company where this huge deposit was lodged.

The deceased had a deposit valued presently at $11.5million (Eleven
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars) and the Company has
issued me a notice to provide his next of kin or Beneficiary by Will
otherwise have the account confiscated within the next sixty official working
days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over two
years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin / Will
Beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued
at $11.5 Million US dollars can be paid to you. This will be disbursed
or shared in these percentages, 60% to me and 40% to you. I have all
necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make.
All I require is your honest Co-operation, Confidentiality and Trust to
enable us sees this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be
executed
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the
law.

Please get in touch with me urgently via E-mail:
johnsonwerner@mail2ireland.com  as I am presently in the Republic of
Ireland (Dublin). And please provide me the
following; this is to enable me commence immediate preparation of all
legal document that will back up our claim.

2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number
