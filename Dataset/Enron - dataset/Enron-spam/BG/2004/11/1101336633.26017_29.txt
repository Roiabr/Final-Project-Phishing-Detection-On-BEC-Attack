MR.Qin Wang
HANG SENG BANK LTD,
DES VOEUX RD.BRANCH
CENTRAL HONG KONG
HONG KONG.

   I am Mr.Qin Wang, credit officer of Hang Seng Bank Ltd,I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium,sorry my English is not very good.

   Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your
opinion.On June 6,1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the 
Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Richard Nault made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million Dollars only) in my branch.Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

   After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, the Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. 
Richard Nault died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Richard Nault did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.

   No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong
Kong, at the expiration of 5(five) years,the money will revert to the
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the
fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner 
to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Nault so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.

   We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and
authorization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and 
letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction.   

   There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the attorney and with my position as the credit officer
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are
interested,please reply immediately.You may reply to my email box,
mrqin_wang2000@yahoo.com.hk

   Upon your response. I shall then provide you with more details and
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please
send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy 
communication. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

   Awaiting your urgent reply.
   Thanks and regards.
   Mr.Qin Wang
