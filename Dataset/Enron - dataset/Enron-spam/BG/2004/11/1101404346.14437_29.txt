Dear friend=2C =


I suspect that you might be surprised to get this send from me as you
originally do not know me=2E

I am Mr=2E Ben Williams=2C the only son of late
 Mr=2E Ndiovu Williams=2C who was slain in a land dispute in Zimbabwe=2E

I got a hold of your profile from your country=92s web site and I thought=

that it may be worthwhile to contact and work with you=2E A few months
before the death of my father=2C he had gone to HOLLAND to deposit the su=
m
of US=244=2C000=2C000 (FOUR MILLION US DOLLAR)=2C in a private security a=
nd
Finance company=2C as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe=2E

This sum was meant for the purchase of chemicals and tractors for the
development of our new farm in Swaziland=2E However this problem came
about when the
 Zimbabwean President Mr=2E ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new land reform
act=2C which utterly affected the rich white farmers and some black
farmers=2E This resulted into killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war
veterans and some lunatics in the society=2E Several innocent people have=

lost their lives as a result of the land reform act=2C in which my father=

is unfortunately one of them=2E

You could look up this information on CNN news daily for up date on the
situation of the Country=2E If however you are in doubt=2C you may also l=
ook
up information pertaining to this fiasco from the Internet on the
following web site=3A =


www=2Edailynews=2Eco=2Ezw=2C

In view of the above conditions my family and me whom are presently in
Zimbabwe decided to transfer our fathers money to a foreign account
since the Zimbabwean law prohibits refugees (asylum seekers) to operate
any type of bank account or being involved in any enormous financial
business deal=2E As the eldest issue of my father=2C I am in quest of for=
 a
genuine overseas collaborator who can help us transfer this money in to
his or her oversea account=2E On the other hand=2C the Zimbabwe governmen=
t
appears to be playing along with them=2E

We are therefore faced with the dilemma of investing this money in
Zimbabwe for the fear of going through the same experience in future=2C A=
s
a businessperson whom I will entrust my future and that of my entire
family in
 his hands=2C I must let you know that this business is completely 100=25=

harmless as we cannot accept to venture into any dangerous deal with our
fortune=2E

Therefore if this request falls within your capacity=2C I would appreciat=
e
that you contact me urgently=2E I would also be available to attend to an=
y
question or concern that you may have per this matter=2E

As gratitude for your assistance=2C we have proposed two options for you=2E=


1) We (you and me) could go into partnership for a proper and profitable
investment of the money in your Country or stable economy=2E

2) I would be willing to give a flexible and negotiable percentage of
15=25 of the total sum to you =


I assume that you would appreciate the sensitive nature of this matter
and the necessity for confidentiality of the same=2E

You may reply to this send through my private mail box=3A
benwilliams=40walla=2Ecom

God bless you and your family=2E =


Yours truly=2C =


Ben Williams

(For The Family)
