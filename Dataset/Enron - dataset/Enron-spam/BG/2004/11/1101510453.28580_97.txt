Please do not allow this to surprise you, I will introduce myself I am
Mr.Wong du a Banker working in a bank in south Korea Until now I am the
account officer to most of the south Korea government accounts and I
have since discovered that most of the account are dormant account
with alot
of money in the account on further investigation I found out that one
particular account belong to the former president of south Koreans MR
PARK CHUNG HEE, who ruled south Koreans from 1963-1979 and this
particular account has a deposit of $48m with no next of kin and this
money can even be placed on cash call because the money is in a safe
deposit with my bank.
 
My proposal is that since I am the account officer and the money or
the account is dormant and there is no next of kin obviously the
account
owner the former president of South Korea has died long time ago, that
you should provide an account for the money to be transferred. The
money that is floating in the bank right now is $48m and this is what
I want
to transfer to your account for our mutual benefit or if you prefer
cash
call then we can arrange it. Please if this is okay by you I will
advice that you contact me through my direct email address. Please this
transaction should be kept confidential. For your assistance as the
account owner we shall share the money on equal basis but 2% of the
total will be set aside. Please this transaction should be kept
confidential.
Your reply will be appreciated,
 
Thank you,
 
Mr. Wong Du
