This will be disbursed or shared in thes percentages, 60% to me and 40% to you. 
 
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest Co-operation, Confidentiality and Trust to enable us see this transaction through.
 
I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me urgently by E-mail: {walter_smith@lawyer.com} and provide me the following below,

1. Full Name
2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number
