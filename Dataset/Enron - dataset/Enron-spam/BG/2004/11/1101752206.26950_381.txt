Attn:My Dear,
Compliments,I barrister Ifeanyi Ikem have decided to bestow this trust on=


you,
which I pray you will not ignore or betray.I appologise in advance for 
any
inconviniences this may cause you. I am Barrister Ifeanyi Ikem the Person=
al
Attorney to late Mr. George K.Marshal, who was a contractor  here in 
Benin
Rep.Who, on the 3rd of Oct 2000, with his entire family were perished 
in
a fierceful  Auto-Crash along Midombo Togo express way.As a matter of 
fact,
my client made a fixed dopsit Amount, valued at (USD$10.7M)with 
Reliance
Bank here in Benin Rep, and upon the duration time of their 
agreement,his
bank started contacting him but no response. Conseqently, the bank 
issued
me a notice to provide  the next of kin to the deceased  as his 
personal
attorney,or have his account confiscated after four years, as it is in 
the
law of this country.
Since then, I have made several contacts to His Countries Embassy in 
order
to locate any of my clients extended relatives,which had also been 
unsuccessful.
Since  I have been unsuccesfull in locating  the relatives for over two
years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the
deceased since none of his relatives were no way to be found so that 
the
proceeds of this account valued at $10.7m could be transffered into 
your
account, thereafter,we will both share it in percentage according to 
our
contributions to boost the success of this great transaction. I have 
all
the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up all the 
claims
we will make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us 
make
this great benefiting transaction successfully.
I guarantee  that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement 
that
will protect you from any breach of the law.  Please get in touch with 
me
as fast as possible  to  enable us discuss further the progress of this
business.
With best regards,
Hon:Bar. Ifeanyi Ikem  Esq,
Senior advocate of Benin(SAB)
