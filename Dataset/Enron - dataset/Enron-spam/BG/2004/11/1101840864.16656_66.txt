Dear Friend,
MR. MARKUS BOPP
Postfach, 3001 Bern Switzerland
Phone number#+41-44-580-4895.

IMPERATIVE AND PRIVATE.
I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge sum of money from a 
deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude 
will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that 
all will be well at the end of the day. We decided to contact you due 
to the urgency of this transaction.

PROPOSITION;
We discovered an abandoned sum of US$32,500,000.00 (Thirty-Two Million 
Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that Belongs 
to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire Family. 
Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward 
to lay claims for this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund 
from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to 
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to have you stand as a 
next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully 
worked out by us for the funds (US$32,500,000.00) to be released in 
your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin. It may Interest you to 
know that we have secured from the probate an order of madamus to 
locate any of deceased beneficiaries.

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual 
Business Endeavour by furnishing me with the following;

1. Your name and address
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers

These requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the 
appropriate Departments for necessary approvals in your favor before 
the transfer can be made. We shall be compensating you with 40%on final 
conclusion of this project, while the rest shall be for us. If this 
proposal is acceptable by you, please response immediately, I await 
your urgent response. In my private e-mail box: (mark_bopp10@yahoo.de)
Best regards,

Mr. Markus Bopp.
