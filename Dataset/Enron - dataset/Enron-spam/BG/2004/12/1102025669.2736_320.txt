I am Mrs Caroline Solange Haafkens from Spain. I am married
to Dr.Franklyn Haafkens who worked with ChevronTexaco in
Nigeria for twenty years before he died in the year 2000.We
were married for twenty-seven years without a child. He
died during one of the riot
in the Niger delta region of Nigeria.He was held hostage
and slain to death by protesting youths of the region.

Before his death we were both born again christians.Since
his death I
decided not to re-marry . When my late husband was alive he
deposited the sum of (Eight Million six hundred thousand
U.S.Dollars)with a bank in the Spain .

Presently, this money is still with the bank and the
management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward
to receive the money or rather issue a letter of
authorisation to somebody to receive it on 
mybehalf if I can not come over.

Presently, I'm with my laptop in a hospital where I have
bee undergoing treatment or cancer of the lungs. I have
since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me
that I have only a few months to live.

It is my last wish to see that this money is invested the
proceed at the end of every year distributed among charity
organisation.

I want a person that is God fearing that will use this
money to fund
churches,orphanages and widows propagating the word of God
and to 
ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made
us to 
understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this
decision because i know that there are alot of poor people
suffering from different kind of disease and nobody to come
to their aid.

With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your
reply I shall give you the contact of the bank.I will also
issue you a letter of authority 
that will prove you as the new beneficiary of this fund.You
are to help me invest this funds into real estate and
stocks.You will be entitled to 10% of every profit you make
in a year. 

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated
herein.

Hoping to hearing from you soon.

waiting for your reply

Yours in Christ,

Mrs Caroline Solange Haafkens
