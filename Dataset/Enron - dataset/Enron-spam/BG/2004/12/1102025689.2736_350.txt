I am Musa Jacob and my younger sister called Gloria Kamara of the same parents 
from Sierre-Leone country

with a bank here in a fixed deposit and the amount is USD45M dollars on a
bank here in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire.

We are presently in Abidjan where the money was been deposited and I have the 
documents backing up the money at the bank for your claims and our late father
told us incase if he died that we should look for someone who has a legitimate 
bank account abroad to help us claim the money as we are young ones,We have
the ID Card issued us from the United Nation here in Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire on 
our arrival as refugess and these will serves you as a proof of who we ARE.

We believe you as an advanced person that you will not betray the trust we 
impose on you at the end of the transfer into your personal bank account.

Please we need you to send to us the followings,

1.your full Name.
2.Your private phone and fax number
3.Your banking information

All this I will submit to the bank for the transfer of
the money to your bank account which you are going to
send.

Bear in mind that this transaction remains confindential to yourself alone.

Based on this we contacted you for an assistance,So that we can front you as 
the beneficiary of the deposited money USD$45M to the bank so that you can
have contacts with the bank for the bank to make the transfer into the account 
you are going to nominate.

Finally, your reward for your noble assistance will be under negotiable.
