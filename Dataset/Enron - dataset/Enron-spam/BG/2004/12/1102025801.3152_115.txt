A man is walking down the street and he sees a boy riding a wagon. The boy
has his dog pulling it with a rope attached to the dogs balls. The man says
"You know if you tied it around his neck, it would go faster." The boy
replies, "I know but then I wouldn't get the cool siren."

On Christmas morning a cop on horseback is sitting at a traffic light, and
next to him is a kid on his brand new bike. The cop says to the kid, "Nice
bike you got there. Did Santa bring that to you?" The kid says, "Yeah." The
cop says, "Well, next year tell Santa to put a tail-light on that bike." The
cop then proceeds to issue the kid a #20.00 bicycle safety violation ticket.
The kid takes the ticket and before the cop rides off says, "By the way,
that's a nice horse you got there. Did Santa bring that to you?" Humouring
the kid, the cop says, "Yeah, he sure did." The kid says, "Well, next year
tell Santa to put the dick underneath the horse, instead of on top."
