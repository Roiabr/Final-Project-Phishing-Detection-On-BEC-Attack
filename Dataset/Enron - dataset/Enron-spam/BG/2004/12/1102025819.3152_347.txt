 Dear Friend,

I would want to use this medium after going through your profile to seek
for assistance in a business transaction which is of mutual benefit. A fo=
reigner
late Mr. Gavin  Norris who is from United State, an Oil Merchant/Contract=
or
with the Federal Government of Nigeria, until his death in a ship mishap
was banking in a bank where i am the chief Accountant. His closing balanc=
e
until his death was US$8.3 million ,which the bank now expects any of his=

available next of kin to claim. 

To this regards, I have been directed by the board of Trustees of the ban=
k
to notify the diseased next of kin, which I have done and found out that
he has no next of kin,which means that this funds will be lost to the gov=
ernment,
which we all know will be stolen . In order to avert this development, my=
self
and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek your indulgence to=

have you stand as late Mr.Gavin  Norris?s next of kin so that the fund wi=
ll
be subsequently transferred and paid into your foreign account.

 On indicating your interest,all documents and proofs to enable you get
this funds will be carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% ri=
sk
free transaction. You will be allowed to retain 30% of the total amount
after the transaction while 10%shall be used for reimbursement of any exp=
enses
incurred in the course of this transaction. The remaining 60% for us awai=
ting
our instruction of disbursement. If this proposal is okay by you, and you=

wish to take advantage of the trust bestowed on you,please kindly contact=

me through this e-mail address to enable me furnish you with relevant det=
ails
to this transaction. 

But if my request has offended your sensibility, please accept my apologi=
es.

Best regards,
Mr.Anthony Onome
