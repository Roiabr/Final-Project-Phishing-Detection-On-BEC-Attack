Good Day =2E

Dear Friend=2C

As you read this=2C I don=3Ft want you to feel sorry for
me=2C because=2C I believe everyone will die someday=2E
My name is HANS LEIF Jnr=2Ea merchant in Dubai=2C
but i hail from NORWAY=2EI have been diagnosed with
Esophageal cancer =2E I am presently in a hospital in
london=2E

It has defiled all forms of medical treatment=2C and
right now I have only about a few months to live=2C
according to medical experts=2E

I have not particularly lived my life so well=2C as I
never really cared for anyone=28not even myself=29but my
business=2E Though I am very rich=2C I was never generous=2C
I was always hostile to people and only focused on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for=2E But
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more
to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world=2E

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to
this world I would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it=2E Now that God has called me=2C I
have willed and given most of my property and assets
to my immediate and extended family members as well as
a few close friends=2E

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so=2C
I have decided to give also to charity
organizations=2C as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth=2E So far=2C I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the U=2EA=2EE=2C
Algeria=2CMalaysia and denmark=2E Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly=2C I cannot do this myself
anymore=2E

I once asked members of my family to close
one of my accounts and distribute the money which I
have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
Pakistan=2C they refused and kept the money to
themselves=2E Hence=2C I do not trust them anymore=2C as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them=2E

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of eighteen million dollars
$18=2C000=2C000=2C00 that I have with a Fuditiary Company=2E I
will want
you to help me collect
this deposit and dispatched it to charity
organizations=2EI have set aside 10% for you and for
your time=2E

God be with you=2E
