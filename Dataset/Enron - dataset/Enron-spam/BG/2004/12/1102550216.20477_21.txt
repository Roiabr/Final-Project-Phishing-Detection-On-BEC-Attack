These com links provide the uplink and downlink needed to enable Internet and satellite TV access while the <strong>In-Systcom</strong> SeaLynx system manages the bandwidth possible on the room-to-room wiring network.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported by <strong>In-Systcom</strong> management, nobody else has this technology nor anything like it. What&#8217;s more, <strong>In-Systcom</strong> is not just targeting the cruise ship industry!<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resorts at cruise ship destinations face the same dilemmas. High-end resorts on remote is
