FROM MR.ABDUL LAWAL
FINANCIAL BANK OF BENIN
REPUBLIC OF BENIN.
WEST AFRICA.

DEAR FRIEND
I am MR.ABDUL LAWAL, the director in charge of auditing and
accounting section of Financial Bank of Benin cotonou
Republic of Benin in West Africa with due respect and
regard. I have decided to contact you on a business
transaction that will be very bene
ficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .
During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my
department came across a very huge sum of money belonging
to a deceased person who died in(Kenya Airways jet)plane
crash on the January 30, 2000 in abidjan replublic of ivory
coast.
(http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/africa/01/30/kenya.airways.crash.01/index.html)
and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in
his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in
our custody either from his family or relation before ou
r discovery to this development.
Although personally, I keep this information secret within
myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be
Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The
said amount was US$24.1M(Twenty Four million One Hundred
Thousand united stat
es dollars).As it may interest you to know, I got your
impressive information through my a friends who works with
the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Benin. It is
him who recommended your person to me to be viable and
capable to champion a busine
ss of such magnitude without any problem .Meanwhile all the
whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the
bonafide next of kin to the deceased,get the required
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has
been put in place and directi
ves and needed information will be relayed to you as soon
as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us
and also benefit yourself to this great business
opportunity.
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my
position in this country as a civil servant,we are not
allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually
raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer
because I work in this b
ank.This is the actual reason why it will require a second
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin
to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he
will need the money to be re-transferred into on his
request as it may be after 
due verification and clarification by the correspondent
branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted
from to your own designated bank account.
May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100%
risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful
arrangement as an insider of the bank before contacting
you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be
entitled to 30% of the t
otal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to
take care of expenses that may arise during the time of
transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me
and my partners.
Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as
we are still in service and intend to retire from service
after we conclude this deal with you.
I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank
until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to
come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the
fund according to percentages previously indicated and
further investment, either
in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.
All other necessary information will be sent to you on your
acceptance to champion this transaction with me.
I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my
personal email address stating your wish in this deal.
Yours faithfully,
Mr.ABDUL LAWAL
