From: Prince Saeeb Usman,
London, U.K

Greetings to you.

I am Prince Saeeb Usman and though I reside in the
U.K, I am actually a citizen of U.A.E. I am the heir
apparent to a family business with its "roots"
in Dubai, U.A.E.I came to know of your name and
address in my search for a reliable and low-key person
to handle a very confidential transaction based on 
unflinching trust as we have not met before. This
transaction involves the transfer of huge sum of
foreign exchange (the United States Dollars)
to a foreign account.
The importance of my position in my family mandated
that I was sent to study for a degree in the U.K. At
the conclusion of my degree program, my family
decided to open the first European branch of the
company in the U.K and I was put in-charge to run it.
This was of course a good beginning for me.

At present, we are at the end of another trading year
and our auditors have once again brought it to our
attention, the tax rates applicable to
our company due to the fact that we the owners are not
British is gradually "killing" our business. Unlike the
last time I was alerted, I have this time, taken a
critical overview of the records from "day one" and
the auditors seem very correct.

This situation when related to my father has really
been disturbing. After much "brain storming", my
father has decided to close the UK branch. He has
directed that we salvage what is left of our
investment and concentrate our efforts on Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates.

Now, you must wonder why I have contacted you! I am
contacting you now because there is an arrangement
that I have personally mapped out to ensure that
what ever cash remaining in the Company account be
transferred to who ever is willing to assist me in
this regards. This sum ($18,500,000.00) has now been
approved for payment and is now ready to be transferred
by my bankers to the account of any individual and or
company, which my company presents as the beneficiary.

Consequently, I am willing to cause our bankers to
transfer the total amount to your account for
subsequent disbursement on our behalf, since we as
foreigners are prohibited by the British tax laws and
Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from
actually maximizing our profit returns. Needless to
say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is
enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20%
of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside
for incidental expenses (internal and external) accrued
between the parties in the course of the 
transaction. You must however note that this
transaction is subject to the following terms and 
conditions. 
a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence
b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality 
c) That you have an unflinching trust in us, and our
ability to complete all official processes with your
co-operation. 
(d) That the funds would be transferred to an ordinary
account which you have total control over. 


All you will be required to do is to draft an
agreement from your end that you will be supplying
Medical and Agricultural Equipment to the tune of
$18,500,000 (Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) in my Company's favor. Once this
agreement is set up, I will need to see the contents
and have a copy submitted to my bankers here so they
can immediately begin the transfer processes of the
stipulated amount in favor of goods to be
supplied(Supposedly) by you.
Modalities have been worked out (secretly) at the
highest levels of the relevant government departments
involved and our bankers for the immediate transfer of
funds within 7-10 working days subject to your
satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance
is that your role is risk-free. To accord this
transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual
security of the fund, the whole approval procedures
will be officially and legally processed with your
name or the name of any company you may nominate as
the bona fide beneficiary, as in an ideal situation.
It is imperative that you bear in mind that having
spent about 19 years in the United Kingdom, I am
averse to having my image and career dented. And bear
in
mind that your confidentiality is required because if
this arrangement fails, I will probably loose
everything I own and have worked for in the U.K

This matter should therefore be treated with utmost
secrecy and urgency required.

Kindly expedite action by contacting me on my e-mail
address, indicating your interest in this transaction.
For swift response to your reply, kindly indicate your
fax and telephone numbers clearly so that I can
explain further, especially by fax. I am urgently
waiting your reply as payment to contractors by my
company is usually made on quarterly basis. 

I thank you in view of your anticipated urgent
co-operation.

Yours Faithfully,

Saeeb Usman.
