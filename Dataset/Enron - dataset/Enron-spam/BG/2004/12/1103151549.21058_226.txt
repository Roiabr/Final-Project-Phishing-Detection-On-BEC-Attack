 Greetings,

I am Mrs Christine Ampatin Go, a divorcee and native of 
Philippines. I would like to have a long lasting and 
confidential relationship with you by entrusting you with 
my life time fortune as I am presently desolated and need 
someone to trust. I do not want to remember my past ordeal 
in the hands of close confidants and family. 
from your profile, I would want to believe strongly that 
you are a very honest person. I have undergone so much 
tumoils in my short but eventful life and i want to go away 
from my all troubles. I hope you will not dissapoint me 
afterall. any way, I was once the mistress of our then 
President, Joseph Estrada, and during his tenure in office, 
he enstrusted me with the sensitive task of safely 
depositing his funds in several financial institutions 
accross the world. my sexual and business relationship with 
Joseph Estrada was a top secret and it suited us both that 
way for years until he made a fatal mistake of leaving my 
letter unburnt after reading. His wife stumbled on it 
and \\\"the cat was let out of the bag\\\" This was a prelude to 
the fracas I had with his wife, Madam Loi and her son, 
Jude. it was a public embarrassment and people became aware 
that I was having such an affair with the President. 
Not quite a long time ago, I was wrongly arrested alongside 
Joseph Estrada\\\'s wife and son in connection with the 27th 
July, 2003 failed coup and was charged with treason, 
trafficking and harbouring of arms and ammunationsin in the 
villa bought for me by the then President Joseph Estrada. 
after much investigation and interrogation, i was released 
on the ground of insufficient evidence but kept under 
severe immigration security watch. 
I know you might be wondering why i am telling you my 
shameful relationship with the then President and that I 
deserved all the problems i have gone throu gh. I do not 
dispute that and i feel so ashamed of myself but the fact 
is that i want a second chance to start afreash and make 
something out of my life. Do not judge me harshly in as 
much as you may want to. I need your assistance and 
urgently too. I want you to assist me claim one of the 
funds deposits i made for the President Estrada overseas 
during the days of my relationship with the then president. 
The documents of other deposits have been confiscated by 
the the government of Madam Gloria Ariyo, the current 
President of my country.The only deposit i can lay claims 
to right now is this one they could not see as I kept the 
documents with one of my close confidants who 
unfortunately, was also arrested. 
The Amount deposited is US$10m. Joseph wanted to use this 
money to acquire some property in real estate in Africa 
which unfortunately, he could not finalise. I want you to 
promise me your total sincerity and will no t betray the 
enermous trust i am bestowing on you. Once you claim this 
money, you will keep and invest the money on trust on my 
behalf in any viable business venture pending when i am 
taken off the immigration security watch list. it is only 
then shall I travel down to meet you and we can sit down 
and deliberate on whether to continue on your line of 
investment or diversify. As soon as i get your consent to 
this subject matter, I will send you a copy of my 
international passport Photograph which i had stored in my 
computer before the government seiezed my international 
passport. Upon the receipt of this mail,please send me your 
full names and contact address to enable me issue out a 
letter of authorisation on your behalf which will ensure 
that you successfuly claim the money when you come in 
contact with the Finance house where the money is lodged. 
Please, respond to my email 
address:ampatingo_c@myway.com
Bes t Regards,
Yours Sincerely,
Mrs Christine Ampatin Go
