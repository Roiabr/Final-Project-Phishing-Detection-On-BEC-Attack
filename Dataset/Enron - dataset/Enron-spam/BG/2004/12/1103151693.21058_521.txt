There was money maped out by the former president of Liberia Charles Taylor to buy ammunition to fight Rebels. This money is in my possesion right now. The sum of USD25 Million which was meant for purchase of ammunition but was not used for that purpose as a result of international presure on Charles Taylor to relinquish power. Right now Charles Taylor has steped down from power for a new government.

The document that is backing the deposit of US$ 25 million are currently with me as the accountant to Charles Taylor. At this junction I can not disclose the security's company 's name to you until you accept my proposal for security reasons.

(2)You are entittled to 30% of the USD25Milllion as your share for your 
assistance. 
 
(4)5% will be map out for miscelleneous expenses during the transaction. 
 
(5)And 65%will be for me Mr.Alex Kajeta I have all necessary legal documents from the security company where I lodged this money to back-up your claim for this money. 
 
All I require is your Honesty and cooperation to enable this deal succeed. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate Arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the Law.
