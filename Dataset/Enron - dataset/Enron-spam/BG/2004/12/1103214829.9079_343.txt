Dear Sir,

I am making this contact with you in good faith, my name is Mr Bello Umanah,
the personal accounting officer to Late Hon. Chuba Okadigbo, the former
Nigeria Senate President. Herein after shall be referred to as my client. 

During my client's tenure as Nigeria Senate President, he was in charge of
Federal Government investments abroad from which he accrued so much money.
And having a personal intention of investing abroad after his tenure, he
secretly deposited the sum of US$20 Million(Twenty Million United States
Dollars) with a Security Company in Madrid, Spain.

But unfortunately, he died on Thursday September 25, 2003 leaving this huge
amount of money in the custody of the Security Company without claim from
anybody. As the personal accounting officer, i was the only person he
confided in and therefore the only person that knows about the existence of
this funds as he was avoiding implications since he was in service then. 

I am interested in a foreign investor with a sound business proposal who is
capable of using his/her facilities to claim and transfer this funds into
his/her account, hence i personally appeal to you seriously for your urgent
assistance to move this money into your country where i believe it will be
judiciously invested for the benefit of both of us. 

I have in my possession every necessary legal document to backup your claim
and which will also enable you work in accordance with the security company
in Madrid, Spain, all i require is your honest cooperation. 

Best regards,

Mr. Bello Umanah
