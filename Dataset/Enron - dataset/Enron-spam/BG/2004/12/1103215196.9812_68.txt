Profile<br>
\\\\\\\\<br>
<br>
US BioTec, Inc. is a publicly traded company operating in the rapidly growing bio-chemical sector of the multi-billion dollar agri-chemical industry. The company's common stock trades under the ticker symbol USBO.PK . US BioTec (USBO) was established to profitably develop, manufacture, market and distribute bio-degradable, non-toxic and non-carcinogenic products to agriculture, the commercial turf industry, forestry, golf courses, professional landscapers, nurseries and mass market retail lawn and garden markets. The company's products are designed to rehabilitate and protect soils and plants through all natural, environmentally friendly alternatives to toxic fertilizers.<br>
<br>
The founders of USBO have worked for over 15 years to produce biological chemicals or ”bio-chemicals” that consistently provide results that add to the profitability of growers, while simultaneously enhancing the soil eco-system and benefiting the treated plant. The products the company has developed offer a better way to care for your crop, lawn, garden, house plants, flowers and most significantly, the environment.<br>
<br>
USBO's proprietary technology of combining natural chemistries with microbial components is the result of years of research with various crops, under a wide array of conditions and crop production problems, in a variety of states. As a result of this effort of product development and on-going refinement, USBO's products are state-of-the-art in their ease of application and product performance. In test markets, the company's products have proven to stimulate plant growth and/or increase yield by 10% to 30%, depending on the species treated and prevailing environmental conditions.<br>
<br>
US BioTec is striving to be the market leader in the bio-chemical sector of the agri-chemical marketplace that is measured world-wide in the tens of billions of dollars annually. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
US BioTec has developed a full line of biodegradable, non-toxic and non-carcinogenic products for the agricultural, forestry, commercial turf, golf course, professional landscaping and mass retail lawn and garden markets. US BioTec's ecologically friendly products can replace many of the toxic pesticides and caustic fertilizers commonly used in the agricultural industry. A second advantage beyond being environmentally friendly is that the company's field studies conducted in four test markets since 1991 indicate that US BioTec's products can stimulate plant growth and increase vegetable crop yield by 10% to 30% depending on the crop and environmental conditions. US BioTec plans to hire a third party to conduct independent tests to determine the precise impact the Company's products have on
crop yield.<br>
<br>
By altering the concentration of natural components, such as phosphorlating compounds, enzymes, amino acids, minerals, carbohydrates, vitamins and microbes in each product, US BioTec can custom design a compound for use on specific crop production problems. For example, some of US BioTec's products are designed to stimulate root growth and another may promote leaf growth, while another can enhance fruiting buds and yet a different product can help alleviate seasonal water stress. The different primary functions of these biotech products are achieved by altering the ratio and concentration of the common components .<br>
<br>
US BioTec believes that biochemical technology could revolutionize the way food is grown! USBO's products stimulate healthier plants that produce higher quantities of crops, and the company's soil products help correct many microbial and mineral problems present in soils today. Plus, US BioTec's soil biostimulants help to rehabilitate the soil ecosystem by breaking down the residual build-up of toxic insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and synthetic fertilizers, thus promoting the restoration of soil to its natural, pre-polluted state. Equally as important is the fact that the company believes these biotech products are economically feasible for the majority of produce growers to purchase considering their current commodity prices.<br>
<br>
US BioTec's products are formulated with bio-chemical components and this bio-chemical technology is not related to genetic engineering technology. US BioTec's biostimulants do not influence a seed's gene function, but work instead to stimulate vegetative plant growth, promote fruiting sites and enhance the plant's immune system function against natural enemies after germination. Although, it is logical that healthier plants will produce all-around healthier seeds.<br>
<br>
US BioTec has already completed its research and development phase, and has formulated approximately thirty products that it believes to be commercially viable. USBO is planning to launch all of its agricultural products in the spring of 2005, and currently plans to launch all of its existing products within 36 months of January 2005.<br>
<br>
/////////<br>
Strategy<br>
\\\\\\\\\<br>
<br>
US BioTec’s mission is to establish itself as a profitable industry leader, pioneering the development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of bio-degradable, non-toxic and non-carcinogenic products to the agriculture, forest, commercial turf, golf course, professional landscaping and commercial nursery industries as well as to the mass market retail lawn and garden market. <br>
<br>
US BioTec believes it already has a very distinct advantage over its competition because it currently has approximately 30 practical, environmentally friendly bio-chemical products ready to be introduced in various existing markets. USBO is in the process of launching its agricultural products by July 2005. The company’s strategic plan is as follows:<br>
<br>
////////////////<br>
Growth Strategy<br>
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<br>
<br>
It is the ultimate goal of US BioTec’s management team to effectively build up the company to sustained profitability while providing shareholders with competitive returns on equity. US BioTec may also choose to utilize an aggressive acquisition strategy to consolidate the highly fragmented and immature bio-chemicals industry. Continued funding of research &amp; development will provide two exceptional products that are some 24-30 months from mass marketing status.<br>
<br>
////////////////////////<br>
Diversification Strategy<br>
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<br>
<br>
As US BioTec builds its brand name, product recognition, distribution network and reputation as the industry leader in the environmentally friendly bio-chemical solutions market, the company will simultaneously seek out other eco-friendly products to distribute.<br>
<br>
As part of its growth strategy through strategic alliances, US BioTec intends to distribute complementary products manufactured by other companies to applicable markets. USBO’s policy is to stay current with new products and technologies wherever and whenever reasonable and profitable. Still, as the company comes across smaller companies that lack distribution capabilities or capital to market their products, but have redeeming products that are ready for market, USBO may form strategic alliances that draw upon the company’s distribution capability to increase revenues through these third party distribution agreements. <br>
<br>
/////////////////////////////<br>
Marketing and Sales Strategy<br>
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<br>
<br>
US BioTec understands that providing revolutionary products is not enough to guarantee the company’s financial success. This is why USBO has designed a detailed marketing and sales strategy that takes into account the unique characteristics of how the agri-chemical industry, the retail lawn and garden industry, the golf course industry, etc. operate. The company’s marketing and sales strategy may potentially include the use of teams of independent manufacturer’s representatives (reps). Each division picks only the best reps that possess both expertise in the science of our products and strong, established relationships with the particular customers and markets they will be targeting. <br>
<br>
Sales representatives in the Agriculture and Commercial markets will be closely supported by US BioTec’s highly trained in-house Technical Sales Representatives (TSR). These TSRs will be available to provide situational analysis, product recommendations and ongoing training, plus information to the teams of reps, dealer sales organizations and customers. <br>
<br>
The marketing of lawn and garden products will be given to an experienced professional rep group or by hiring an experienced professional mass market guru.<br>
