      STRATEGY<br>
      To create greater shareholder value, Patch intends to follow a strategy 
      of global energy investment alone or in joint partnership. At the same time, 
      it continues to review investments outside the energy sector where there 
      is the opportunity for substantial return on investment.<br>
      PAII offers investors participation in the burgeoning global oil and gas 
      industry with a ground-floor investment opportunity in a pharmaceutical 
      company. Based on Patch's aggressive initiatives for growth, there is continued 
      optimism the share price will begin moving upwards to a target price of 
      $1.00 in the near future.</font></td>

      Soaring global energy demand has put Patch International in the right place 
      at the right time to capitalize on global energy projects where there is 
      a substantial return on investment. Its latest project, in partnership with 
      First Petroleum Inc., a private corporation, is in energy rich North Africa.<br>
      <br>
      Patch and First Petroieum executives recently returned from North Africa 
      and Europe where they held discussions with top officials from Algeria and 
      Libya. Subsequently, they received a partnership letter from the Algerian 
      Ministry of Energy and Mines.<br>
      <br>
      First Petroleum's, Dr. Danilo Mancin, an international business and government 
      specialist, who has extensive experience in dealing with senior government 
      and industry executives in North Africa, was accompanied by David Stadnyk, 
      president of Patch.<br>
      <br>
      Algeria has extensive hydrocarbon wealth and is relatively unexplored. Currently, 
      its oil reserves are estimated at 15.4 billion bbl and its gas reserves 
      are 146.5 TCF.<br>
      <br>
      Besides Algeria, projects have been identified in neighboring Libya, which 
      has some 36-billion bbl of oil reserves and 47.4 TCF of natural gas reserves.</font></td>

            OWN PATCH INTERNATIONAL INC.<br>
            <br>
            • PATCH is uniquely and strategically positioned to participate 
            in underdeveloped massive oil and gas energy projects in Algeria and 
            Libya as well as in Europe.<br>

            • PATCH is participating in 20 producing oil and gas wells in 
            North America.<br>
            <br>
            • In partnership with noted investment house Rothschild's and 
            other top investor groups, PATCH'S investment value in pharmaceutical 
            company Pharmaxis currently stands at close to $10 million, and with

            • PATCH is in the right industry at the right time. Oil and gas 
            are at historically high prices and the fact remains that oil and 
            gas will continue to be the dominant forms of energy for years to 
            come at increased prices.<br>

            • PATCH has an established experienced senior management team. 
            CEO & President, David Stadnyk, has a significant background in 
            the energy and investment sectors spanning some 20 years.</b></font></td>
