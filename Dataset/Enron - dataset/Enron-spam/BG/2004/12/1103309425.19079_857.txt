I am Barrister  samson stephen , a solicitor. I am the private Attorney=
 to Mr. Winston H Guenter a National of your country, who used to be Cr=
ude Oil Marchent in Nigeria. On the 21st of April he and his entire imm=
ediate family were involved in a car accident along  Sagbamo Express Ro=
ad. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.=20
 =20
Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any =
of my client's  relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After the=
se several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over=
 the Internet, to locate any bodywho is willing help to retrieve this f=
und, hence I contacted you.  I have contacted you to assist in repatrat=
ing the money and (property) left behind by my client before  they get =
confisicated or declared unserviceable by the Finance Company where thi=
s huge deposits were lodged where the deceased had an account valued at=
 about four Million United States  Dollars  (Us4,000,000.00) has issued=
 me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicate=
d.

Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 yea=
rs now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the dec=
eased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this ac=
count valued at 15 Million Dollars can be paid to you and then you and =
me can share the money. 50% for me and 40% for you  and 10%  will be us=
ed for any expenses that this might cost on the process of this  transa=
ction. I have all necessary legal documents  that can be used to back u=
p any claim we may make.=20
 =20
All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal th=
rough. I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legit=
imate arrangement that will protect you from any breach  of the law. It=
 is 100% risk-free=20

Awaiting to hear from you soon.=20
