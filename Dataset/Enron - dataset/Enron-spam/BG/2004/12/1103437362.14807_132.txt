Attn: Sir,
 
Taking into considerations that we have not met before,l know this mail
although it's for good motive,may come to you as a surprise.l got your co=
ntact
address through the international business directory. l decided to contac=
t
you for this reason believing that you would be capable to work-out this
deal for the interest of us based on what we have in the file here
 
I am incharge of the Auditing and Accounting Unit foreign Remittance Depa=
rtment
of the ECO Bank Plc. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support=

and co-operation to carry out this transaction. During our investigation
and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of
money belonging to a deceased person who died on November 16  2002 in a
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank
without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or re=
lation
before our discovery to this development. Although personally, I keep thi=
s
information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans
and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The
said amount was us$18M (Eighteen million united states dollars). 
 
To this effect, I  decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can
stand in as the next of kin to the deceased and claim this money. We need=

a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the cus=
tomer
was a foreigner. And we dont want this money to go into the banks treasur=
e
as unclaimed fund.
 
Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I wi=
ll
perfect every documents to be in accordance with the banking law and guid=
elines
so you have nothing to worry about.
 
All i required from you is to account for us to use.We will use normal ba=
nking
proceedure and legal means to transfer the fund legally and immediately
within seven to ten working days,the fund will have been transfered into
your designated account abroad.What I request is absolute secrecy and Con=
fidentiality.And
that you will not disappoint me when the fund is transfered into your acc=
ount.
 
We have agreed that 35% of the money will be for you, 5% for expenses inc=
urred
on the both side while 60% will be for me. Remember "GOODthings takes tim=
e
to happen while GREAT things takes all at onces". If you are going to hel=
p
me, indicate by replying this mail as soon as possible.I await your immed=
iate
reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest. 
 
Once I receive your reply, I will send you the form of application for im=
mediate
application of claim. Thanks for your anticipated assistance. Please indi=
cate
your interest here or in my alternative private e-mail mailto: address:

Mr.Michael Ubahka
