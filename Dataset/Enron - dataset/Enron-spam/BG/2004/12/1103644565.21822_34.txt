New Technology for the Third World, December 2004

Production Mini-plants in mobile containers. Worldwide Partners program

SN World Foundation will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and necessary support for production in series of Mini-plants in mobile=20containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring,=20piping, and installation parts; that is, they are fully equipped... and the Mini-plant is ready for production.

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Water purification, Dehydrated food, Steel Nails, Fruit juice preparation, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar=20Bending for Construction Framework, Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa=E7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed=20Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups, Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Medical assistance mobile=20units, Sanitary Material, Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc.=20
SN World Foundation has started a Co-investment program for the installation of small Assembly Plants to manufacture, in series, the Mini-plants of portable=20production on site, region or country where required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the International Trade=20System, with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade.

Due to financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the best solution is setting up Assembly Plants on the same countries and regions, using local resources=20(labor, some equipment, etc.) SN World Foundation participates at 50% (fifty percent) for investment of each Assembly Plant.
