I need to claim. I shipped the oil to India, but I am presently under hou=
se

Well, 6months ago I was arrested for involvment in oil bunkering(smugglin=
g)But
I was released and placed under house arrest because the government did
not find any proof to convict me.Pls donnot be afraid to work with me bec=
ause
Oil bunkering is not such a bad business and I am not a bad person.

You see, I am unable to travel to India to collect the payment for the oi=
l

What I need from you, is for you to go to India, and sign and claim this
funds from India.
I am being tried in Court. So untill I am pronounced innocent I cannot le=
ave
the country. And I need that money so that my business and family does no=

I need a foreign party to help me with the claim because it will be risky=

to use any of my former partners ...I hope you understand my predicament.=


All I need from you is to travel to India to sign and claim the payment
on my behalf,(in your name). 
OR 
We can arrange for an online banking transaction....please choose which
procedure will be better for you.

The amount in question is US$30.2m And I offer you 20% of it for your hel=
p.
If U are willing and able to work with me, I will send you more details,
and tell you how we can work in partnership. You see, Nigeria is the bigg=
est
Producer of Oil in Africa and I am well connected and able to export more=

shipments of Oil.
If you can be my partner you will help me to claim oversees payments.When=

I ship the Oil.
