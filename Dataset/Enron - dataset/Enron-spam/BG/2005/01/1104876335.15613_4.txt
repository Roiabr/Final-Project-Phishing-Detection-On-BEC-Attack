The Industry

Heart disease is the most common cause of death and cardiovascular disease
affects over 60 million people worldwide. The largest area of growth in the
Health Care Sector is in Patient Management. This growth is caused by
patients with chronic conditions, who are forced to make frequent and costly
hospital visits to monitor their condition. 



WHY IVVO?

 

IVVO is a well-established company that has been operating for over eight
years. IVVO currently has two additional products in their 2nd clinical
trials, a pregnancy labor monitor and a fetal heart rate monitor, along with
12 Patents that will allow them to extend their technology to other emerging
medical solutions. IVVO is currently profitable with additional royalty
income beginning in 2005. IVVO has sufficient funds on hand to take them
well into 2006. 

 

IVVO is a momentum play with incredible short-term potential.  Risk adverse
traders take note.
