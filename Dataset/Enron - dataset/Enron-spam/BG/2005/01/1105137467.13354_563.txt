share with you a program that helps Animal Rescues, Shelters, Schools, Churches, and other Non

simple as collecting<BR>cell phones that are no longer in use.<BR><BR><BR><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>The Charity Werks Program is simple to implement; we will 
do all we can to make it easy and profitable. Charity pays the charity for each cell phone that 
it<BR>collects (depending on model and condition of the phone), and the person<BR>or organization 
that donates the cell phone/phones can receives a tax deduction.<BR>Depending upon which study 
you look at, there is an estimated 250 million cell phones<BR>in people's homes in the United 
States alone and over 55 million cell<BR>phones discarded every year and growing.&nbsp; The 
number of discarded cell<BR>phones is predicted to swell to 500 million phones by the end of 
2005. <BR>People seem to feel that their old cell phones have value and they are<BR>reluctant to 
discard them into the trash.&nbsp; With a charitable motive,<BR>people are willing to take that 
old cell phones and donate them for a<BR>cause they believe in whereas they would be reluctant to 
take the time<BR>to find and deliver the cell phone for a small cash payment.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR
