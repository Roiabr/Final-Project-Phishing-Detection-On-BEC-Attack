Dear Friend

 

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.

My name is Andrew Adams a merchant in PHILIPPINES, I have been diagnosed with Esophageal 
cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, 
according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for 
anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always 
hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now i regret 
all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the 
world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different 
way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property 
and assets to my immediate and extended familymembers as well as a few close friends. I want God to be 
merciful to me

and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity

organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on

earth. So far,

 

I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,

Algeria and Malaysia, Indian and Pakistan. Now that my health has

deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.

 

I once asked members of my family to close one of my

accounts in Switzerland and distribute the money which I have there to

charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept

the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they

seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. Now I want you to assist me in getting some 
cash deposit claim and distribute to charity and people of the tsunami disaster.

 

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge

Cash deposit of $36,000.000.00 million united states dollars that I

have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me

collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.

 

I have set aside twenty percent for you and for your time.

 

My email address is:  aadrews1@netscape.net

 

 

regards

 

 

Andrew Adams
