<br> Half the work that is done in this world is to make things appear wha=

<br> But this is where you come in: Between now and November, you, the Ame=
rican people, you can reject the tired, old, hateful, negative politics of=
 the past. And instead you can embrace the politics of hope, the politics =
of what's possible because this is America, where everything is possible.
<br> If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know=
 what you're doing.	W. Edwards Deming=09
<br> I missed shouting carefully.
<br> We are discreet sheep; we wait to see how the drove is going, and the=
n go with the drove.	-Mark Twain [Samuel Langhornne Clemens] (1835-1910)=09=

<br> The politicians dislike playing all day long.

<br> Brian was a boy with Down's Syndrome. He was taking several medicatio=
ns. Brian came from a nurturing family and extended family who provided hi=
m with every opportunity. His mother was a teacher and wanted what was bes=
t for him. He exhibited no language and was considerably behind his other =
friends with Down?s Syndrome. We set up a noun program at school. At first=
 he seemed disinterested. He looked at the pictures and sucked his thumb. =
The more we encouraged him to engage the keyboard, the more he sucked his =
thumb. We then paired him with a child who was very interested in the noun=
 program. Suddenly the two were fighting over who was next to pick a pictu=
re. He worked several times a week at the computer. At his 3-year IEP, the=
 team shook their heads. They didn't understand. Despite the track record =
of many students with Down?s Syndrome, Brian's language was his best skill=
 I smiled and his mother winked at me.
