Helms,

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. (OTC-E O G I)
Domestic Oil and Gas Stock Under Accumulation?
Volume Last Month: Over 7.3 Million Shares Traded
Friday's Close: $.125


Watch This Stock Monday! A Large promotional Campaign
is Underway This Weekend. Some of These Little Oil and
Gas Stocks Have Been Really Moving Lately. And When
Some of them Move, They Really Go...Gains of 100%,
200% or More Are Not Unheard Of. U-C-P-I and X-C-H-C are Two
Examples..

 


Reasons To Consider (E O G I):

*Emerson Oil & Gas holds a 50% working interest in the
W.T. Davis well and lands within Township 23 North and
Range 13 West of Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The net
revenue interest of the lease is 75%. The W.T. Davis
Well is located in the Arkana Field and initially
produced from the Haynesville Formation of the Cotton
Valley Series. With the worldwide focus on energy
needs being front and center in the public eye,
Emerson feels that with its first class management and
discretionary project choices, the company will
continue to serve its shareholders well.


*Emerson is Identifying additional step out
opportunities on its Louisiana property.

*Emerson has signed a letter of intent to earn 50%
working interest in the Rinsland well and Lease in
Bossier Parish Louisiana.

*Emerson's North-West Louisiana drilling efforts
follow closely to its philosophy of high-potential low
risk re-entry projects in developed fields. By
maintaining this conservative, but revenue driven
philosophy and mission statement, Emerson enables
itself to build a strong revenue base for the company
and its shareholders, while taking the lowest possible
risk in achieving this goal.

microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk
factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. is not a
reporting company registered under the Securities Act
of 1934 and hence there is limited public information
available about the company. Other factors include:
the company had no revenue in its most recent quarter
and is not currently revenue producing.The company has
a nominal cash position. The company is going to need
financing to complete some business transactions and
begin revenue producing. If that financing does not
occur, the company may not be able to continue as a
going concern in which case you could lose your entire
investment. Other factors include general economic and
business conditions, the ability to acquire and
develop specific projects, the ability to fund
operations and changes in consumer and business
consumption habits and other factors over which
Emerson Oil and Gas Inc. has little or no control. The
