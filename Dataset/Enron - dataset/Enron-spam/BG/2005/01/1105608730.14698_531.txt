Hello,

I found your email address (bait@em.ca) while looking at your website, and thought I'd see if you would be interested in my services.

My name is Steve McAnulla. I am a graphic designer that has built my reputation by creating websites and custom graphics for people with smaller budgets. I would like to offer my services to your business because I think we could both benefit from doing business together.

I create completely unique, quality websites at a very low cost. Most of my sites fall in the range of $500 to $700 and are rich with features. My portfolio is online at http://www.customguru.com/portfolio.html . There you may also take a quick look at what my customers are saying about my work, and view the finished products for yourself (using the link above). You may also contact any of my customers for a reference.

My turn over rate is expedient!

I have made sites for Hollywood special effects companies, musical artists, jewelry stores, sporting events, giant music festivals, talent agencies, bed and breakfast lodges, ... and a lot more!

DO YOU WANT TO RANK HIGHER IN THE SEARCH ENGINES??? If I were to design / re-design your site I would also submit your website to all of the major search engines and over 1,000 business link directory websites for no extra charge. This action can generate a substantial amount of extra traffic to your site. I can still provide this service if you are happy with your current website.  I charge $50 per website submitted or $20 per month on a monthly submission subscription. For more information on subscriptions, please visit our sister site at www.searchbooster.net .

If our web design services sound like something you would be interested in, please visit my website at http://www.customguru.com for more details.

Thank you for taking time to read this, and I hope to hear back from you soon.


Sincerely,

Steve McAnulla
