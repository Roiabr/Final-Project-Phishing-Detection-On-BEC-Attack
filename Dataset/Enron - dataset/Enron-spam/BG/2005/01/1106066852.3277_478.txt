From Onome Obi
email:onomeobi78@netscape.net

Dear friend,
How are you doing today? 
I hope fine. if so glory be to God. my names is Onome obi 25yrs and I am the daughter to the late former minister of agriculture in Nigeria. my dad died since last years in a ghastly plane crash on his way back from Kenya, and since then life has not been easy for me and my family anyway i thank God that i am alive today. 

Since the death of my dad things have not been easy with us. Though my dad died leaving a huge amount of funds and the government has refused to release this money because the money has been lodged in foreign account. I and my family have gone through hell even my dadsbrothers could not help us and the only given option now for us to have a reliable foreigner that can assist us with his/her foreign account so that the funds can be transferred into his or her account. After this has been done my family and I are willing to offer 25% of the funds to anyone that can assist us so that we can claim our money. 

My mum has been so ill and things are not really going well with us here. I decided to contact you because i knew God was gong to use you to assist me and my family from our present predicament.As soon as we have been able to collect this money I and my family will be coming overseas so we can start up a new life and invest in a profitable business venture i will be glad if you can assist. There is nothing to fear about as i have attached my pics for proper identification as i write this I write in tears and pains, I appeal to you to assist me so that the funds can be transfer I will give u more details as soon as hear from you. 

I want you to know that i have been directed by the spirit to send this to you, may the lord bless you richly as you assist my family and me in regaining our lost life back as this is my mum's only wish right now? and do please reply me with this email address: 
onomeobi78@netscape.net

Best regards 
Onome Obi
