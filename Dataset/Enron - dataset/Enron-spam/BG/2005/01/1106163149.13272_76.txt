EL GORDO INTERNATIONAL LOTTERY
C\ Don Jaime I nº11 2º  
50.003 Zaragoza  
España  
 
Ref: EAASL/941OYI/02/SHYN
Batch: 12/25/0034 
 
We are pleased to inform you of the result of the EL GORDO DE LA PRIMITIVA HIGH-STAKE INTERNATIONAL LOTTERY PROGRAM which was held on the 30th December, 2004. Due to mix up of names, the results were finally released on 30th December, 2004. Your Email address attached to ticket number 025-11464992-750 with serial number 2113-05 drew the lucky numbers 4-18-24-30-31-35 which consequently won the lottery in the 1st category.
You have therefore been approved for a lump sum payout of US$1,000,000.00 (One Million United States Dollars) in cash credited to file EAASL/941OYI/02/SHYN. This is from a total cash prize of US $50 Million dollars shared amongst the first fifty (50) lucky winners in this category. All participants were selected through a computer ballot system drawn from 25,000 names from Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and North America as part of our international promotions program which we conduct twice every year. 
 
This year Lottery Program Jackpot is the largest ever for El-Gordo Lottery. The estimated $50 million jackpot would be the sixth-biggest in Europe history. The biggest was the $363 million jackpot that went to two winners in a May 2000 drawing of The Big Game Mega Millions' predecessor. 
 
Your fund is now deposited in an offshore bank insured in your name. Due to the mix up of some numbers and names, we advice that you keep this award from public notice until your claim has been processed and your money remitted to your nominated bank account as this is part of our security protocol to avoid double claiming or unwarranted taking advantage of this program by the general public.
 
Please note that your lucky winning number falls within our European booklet representative office in Europe as indicated. In view of this, your US$1,000,000.00 (One Million United States Dollars) would be released to you by our affiliate bank in Europe. Our agent will immediately commence the process to facilitate the release of your funds to you as soon as you make contact with her.

In order to avoid unnecessary delays and complications, please endeavor to quote your Reference (EAASL/941OYI/02/SHYN) and Batch numbers (12/25/0034) in every correspondence with your agent.
