A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a shp, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. Those who are willing to sacrifice essential liberties for a little order, will lose both and deserve neither. Abstainer: a weak person who yields to the temptation of denying himself a pleasure. The great thing about television is that if something important happens anywhere in the world, day or night, you can always change the channel. Yesterday is a dream, tomorrow but a vision. But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and every tomorrow a vision of hope. Look well, therefore to this day. What contemptible scoundrel has stolen the cork to my lunch? Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut.

Specialization is for insects. The Babylon project was our last, best hope for peace. .. It failed. .. But in the year of the Shadow war it became something greater: our last, best hope .. for victory. The year is 2260, the place: Babylon 5.The problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind. Yesterday is a dream, tomorrow but a vision. But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and every tomorrow a vision of hope. Look well, therefore to this day. Solitude, if rightly used, becomes not only a privilege but a necessity. Only a superficial soul fears to fraternize with itself. Touch is the most fundamental sense. A baby experiences it, all over, before he is born and long after he learns to use sight, hearing, or taste, and no human ever ceases to need it. Keep your children short on pocket money - but long on hugs. Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We don't love to be loved; we love to love. Distance between two hearts is not an obstacle; rather a great reminder of just how strong true love can be. Why is it drug addicts and computer afficionados are both called users? True friendship comes when the silence between two people is comfortable. The great thing about television is that if something important happens anywhere in the world, day or night, you can always change the channel. Those who are willing to sacrifice essential liberties for a little order, will lose both and deserve neither. Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy. Love takes up where knowledge leaves off. Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies. You can widen your life by yourself, but to deepen it you need a friend. Each encounter that becomes a friendship turns into a lifeline. One can never have too many, only too many to properly take care of. Take away love and our earth is a tomb. Hope is like a road in the country: there was never a road, but when many people walk on it, the road comes into existence. Reality is an illusion that occurs due to lack of alcohol. You can't be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline. It helps if you have some kind of a football team, or some nuclear weapons, but at the very least you need a beer. Give me a woman who loves beer and I will conquer the world. An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them. Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within. Before I got married I had six theories about bringing up children; now I have six children and no theories. Too often we give our children answers to remember rather than problems to solve. A woman drove me to drink and I didn't even have the decency to thank her. When love is not madness, it is not love. Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work. Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life. Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut. Life's challenges are not supposed to paralyze you, they're supposed to help you discover who you are. Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then do it. Love takes up where knowledge leaves off. Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we commit no sin, we go to heaven. So, let's all get drunk and go to heaven! Compassion alone stands apart from the continuous traffic between good and evil proceeding within us. Why is it drug addicts and computer afficionados are both called users? You can widen your life by yourself, but to deepen it you need a friend. Each encounter that becomes a friendship turns into a lifeline. One can never have too many, only too many to properly take care of. Autumn is the time when seasons merge because of bare necessity. It's not that chocolates are a substitute for love. Love is a substitute for chocolate. Chocolate is, let's face it, far more reliable than a man. If you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere. No elected body is the country, we are the country. You and me. Us. It can only stay that way as long as we care to keep it so. Blessed is the man who, having nothing to say, abstains from giving us wordy evidence of the fact. All right, Brain, I don't like you and you don't like me -- so let's just do this and I'll get back to killing you with beer. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. The quality of the moment is more important than the number of our days. Begin doing what you want to do now. We are not living in eternity. We have only this moment, sparkling like a star in our hand and melting like a snowflake. Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then do it. Very little is needed to make a happy life. It is all within yourself, in your way of thinking. I discovered I always have choices and sometimes it's only a choice of attitude. Time is never wasted when you're wasted all the time. A woman drove me to drink and I didn't even have the decency to thank her. Those who are willing to sacrifice essential liberties for a little order, will lose both and deserve neither. If you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere. What the world really needs is more love and less paper work. When solving problems, dig at the roots instead of just hacking at the leaves. Abstainer: a weak person who yields to the temptation of denying himself a pleasure. Blessed is the man who, having nothing to say, abstains from giving us wordy evidence of the fact. The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands in times of challenge and controversy. Without question, the greatest invention in the history of mankind is beer. Oh, I grant you that the wheel was also a fine invention, but the wheel does not go nearly as well with pizza. Reduce the complexity of life by eliminating the needless wants of life, and the labors of life reduce themselves. The great thing about a computer notebook is that no matter how much you stuff into it, it doesn't get bigger or heavier. When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we commit no sin, we go to heaven. So, let's all get drunk and go to heaven! Abstainer: a weak person who yields to the temptation of denying himself a pleasure. When solving problems, dig at the roots instead of just hacking at the leaves. Before I got married I had six theories about bringing up children; now I have six children and no theories. A kiss makes the heart young again and wipes out the years. Hatch a dream and then believe it. A book may lie dormant for fifty years or for two thousand years in a forgotten corner of a library, only to reveal, upon being opened, the marvels or the abysses that it contains, or the line that seems to have been written for me alone. In this respect the writer is not different from any other human being: whatever we say or do can have far-reaching consequences.

The year is 2260, the place: Babylon 5.Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots.
