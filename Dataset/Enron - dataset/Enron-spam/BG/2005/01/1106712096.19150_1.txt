Hot OTC Stock Picks
Our Hot Picks Were UP Over 300% for 2004
Here is our FIRST Hot Pick for 2005

Subscribers, Investors, Analysts, Stock Brokers:
Urgent Stock Breakout Alert

American IDC Corp. OTC: ACNI
Price: .04
Target: .20 in 7 Days
Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV, 
Technologically Superior to AOL TV Clips and Movie Trailers.
Investors Brace for Worldwide Revenue Explosion.

Without hype or fanfare, ACNI has not only put itself on top of 
the list for revolutionary Internet success stories, it has 
completely re-written the qualifying criteria. ACNI has completed 
the worldwide launch of its revolutionary Broadband Internet 
Television, solidifying explosive revenues for this proprietary 
video technology powerhouse. While most investors are completely 
unaware of this significant achievement, that will change very 
quickly.
 
ACNI is positioned much like today's cable TV giants that invested 
heavily in their technology over 20 years ago and are now earning 
a thousand times over what was initially spent each year from their 
current subscribers.

The driving force behind ACNI's technology that enables streaming 
24/7 Broadband Internet Television, by comparison, is more highly 
sophisticated than the partial movie trailers or 15-second clips 
from "Top TV Moments" shown by AOL to subscribers. Combine the 
fact that ACNI is continuously providing thousands of revenue 
generating Hollywood classic movies, with expanding content of 
Sports, Music, Educational, Television Series, and Children's 
Programming, clearly provides a superior cutting-edge advantage 
keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest growing sector 
of the Internet.

ACNI's programming through its 100% Company-owned network,
E-TVHollywood, is the first full-screen Broadband Digital 
streaming channel on the Internet in High-Definition (HD) 
Quality.
The technological breakthrough that supplies the groundwork for 
record setting multi-millions for ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using 
movie industry code which allows for the necessary transcoding 
into video for Broadband.

ACNI is the perfect play for explosive short-term gains with a 
small float estimated at under 20 million shares and a market 
value at around $1.5 million. We expect massive block buying with 
record setting price and volume breakouts. We are advising urgent 
accumulation by our subscribers as huge news is due to be released 
that will send share prices soaring.
