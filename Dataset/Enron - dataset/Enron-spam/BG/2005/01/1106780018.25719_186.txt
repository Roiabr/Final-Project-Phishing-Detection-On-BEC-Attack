Dear Sir

Your contact was reviewed after a careful search on the 
net and devoted
prayer session to our divine redeemer
who can only strenghting your resolve to help us out.
We are the immediate family of late Col Ibrahim Calibale, 
the rebel
commander in ivory coast that was killed in Bouake county 
on
7/02/2004.
I with my mother and two sisters escaped into Porto-novo 
Benin
republic
after the incident when it became clear that the central 
government
Abidjan wanted us eliminated by all means. Presently we 
staying
with united nations high commission for refugee (UNHCR) 
here for
security reasons. Just last week we received some vital 
information
and copies of documents from his lawyer back home proving 
that
our father had some deposit in a security company in 
Spain. Now
we have opened up communication with the Spanish company 
and they
have confirmed been in position of some United States 
Dollars Eleven million three hundred thousand (USD$
11.300,000) only in his favor and have agreed to releasing 
same
upon our request but not until provide valid proof as his 
next of kin.
Now for the fact that none of us here possessed any valid 
traveling
documents because of the circumstances of our exit from 
home, we
are afraid that we will run into trouble if we request for 
the
repatriation
of the deposit to this place, hence we are kindly 
requesting your
assistance to help us receive the deposit in your country. 
We are
ready to offer you some reasonable portions of the deposit 
if you
can oblige us your help.
Further information will be advance to you once you 
indicate your
interest.Please send your reply through email 
account:traore@zoznam.sk

Yours faithful
