Dear Friend,

I am a Branch Manager with CITIZENS BANK PLC (C.B), My name
is Mr.Collins Mark,a banker.

I am the personal Account Manager to late Engineer David who used to work=

with shell Development Company in Nigeria. Here in after, shall be referr=
ed
to as my Client On April 21/ 2002 my client, his wife, and their three ch=
ildren
were involved in a car accident along Sagamu express way.

All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives in the proces=
s
of the accident, since then I have made several inquiries to locate any
of my clients extended relatives or his next of kin, this has also proved=

unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to cont=
act

bank where this huge deposit were lodged,particularly with our bank CITIZ=

u.s. dollars) The foreign remittance department of my bank has issued me
a notice as the branch manager and personal account manager to the deceas=
e,to
provide the next of kin. Or have the account confiscated within the next
ten official working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2years
now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the decease=
d
so that this account valued at ($25.5 million u.s.dollars) can be paid to=

you as the next of kin since you bear the same surname with him and then
me and you Can share the money.70% to me and 30% to you.We are going to
engage the services of an attorney who will help us to depose a sworn aff=
idavit
in the Federal high court.Please you should understand that this transact=
ion
is a deal and should remain very confidential between you and me since I
am still working with my bank.

gh.

t
will protect you from any breach of the Law. Do include your private phon=
e
