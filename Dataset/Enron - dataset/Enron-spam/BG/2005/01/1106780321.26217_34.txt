WIRELESS REBOOTING<br>
<br>
Nighthawk has designed simple, easy to install, wireless remote rebooting devices specifically for computer users, IT and ISP professionals. Anyone who has ever experienced the frustration of having to travel to a remote site simply to reboot a locked-up computer, router, or other electronically controlled device prone to system lock-up will appreciate the benefit of this simple, ‘plug and play’ solution. <br>
<br>
<br>
WIRELESS TRAFFIC CONTROL<br>
<br>
Nighthawk Systems have been used extensively in traffic applications all over the US. The low cost, wide coverage, and group call capability of paging make our controls the ideal solution for remote control of traffic applications of all types. Paging will always outperform cellular in up front cost, monthly air time cost, geographic coverage, and the ability to address multiple signs with one call.<br>
<br>
<br>
WIRELESS FIREHOUSE ALERT SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
Nighthawk Systems continues to provide a great low cost solution for Firehouse Automation. Using paging signals, &nbsp;our Firehouse PT/FAS can turn on lights, open doors, activate wake up alarms, activate firehouse traffic lights, and send messages to printers or variable message signs.<br>
<br>
WIRELESS ELECTRIC UTILITY APPLICATIONS<br>
<br>
Nighthawk has devoted a significant amount of research and development efforts specifically for Utility Industry applications. While our products can be used to remotely control virtually any electrical on\off application, we have focused our development efforts in two areas that have short term pay back for utilities; whole house disconnect and load management.<br>

EMERGING COMPANY 1st ALERT - NIGHTHAWK SYSTEMS INC.<br>
<br>
NOW IS THE TIME... As testimony to the usefulness, quality and uniqueness of our products, these accomplishments have come despite the inability to effectively implement and sustain a marketing campaign. In many cases, customers have literally searched for solutions until they've found our products. <br>
<br>
We plan to change our marketing efforts going forward to reach the full market potential of our product line and the applications which it can be utilized."<br>
<br>
Mr. Saathoff (Nighthawk's Chief Executive Officer), "It is our goal to have our products become ubiquitous in both commercial and consumer applications. As such, I believe the future for the Company and its shareholders is bright as we work toward the following sales and marketing objectives in 2005": <br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;Revenue growth through:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;Hiring sales and marketing personnel. &nbsp;We plan to increase our<br>
sales force with experienced salespeople to effectively target<br>
existing and new markets. &nbsp;Those individuals that are specialized in a field will be assigned to those market applications of our products.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;Product marketing including print media and attendance at trade<br>
shows. &nbsp;This method has proved the most effective for our Company to date, and we plan to increase our presence in the current<br>
space to attract new customers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;An improved Internet presence, including an e-commerce website<br>
for retail sales.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;Leveraging existing customer relationships by upselling new<br>
products or fully integrating systems with our Company's products.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;The establishment of distribution and dealer networks. &nbsp;Through an effective dealer network, we can increase awareness in our products and utilize a dealer's sales force to actively promote our products.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;New applications in irrigation control, civil defense and emergency management. &nbsp;The current product design can be altered with little cost to the Company to effectively be implemented into a wide array of fields. &nbsp;Through our commitment of funding, we can now research all possible applications and begin to market directly to new customers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;The development and launch of a product designed to be used for<br>
multiple purposes by consumers.<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition to the marketing and sales objectives, we have identified the following strategic goals: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;Joint ventures with wireless service providers and equipment<br>
manufacturers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;-- &nbsp;The identification of complementary products and companies for<br>
potential acquisition.<br>
