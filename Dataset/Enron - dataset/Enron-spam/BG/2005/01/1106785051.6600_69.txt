NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Millennium National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the Mi|lennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

Mi||ennium earlier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into acquisition negotiations.

Both loca| De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two entities. "Basically we're both from the same industry, and together I believe we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," said Robert McA||ister, CE0 & President of Mil|ennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, "We are considering Millennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAl|ister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for both Millennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is consistent with our overa|l business p|an. It has always been our intent to target and acquire successful, high-profi|e events and their promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation is the key, not on|y to our bottom line, but a|so to the success of each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi|lennium sees the Match Point acquisition ultimate|y being ab|e to bring net revenues to MNEI's bottom |ine. MNEI sees both the international television audience and the ability to attract a Fortune 5OO as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the deal to be consummated in this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mil|ennium ITC inc|udes top Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC champion Jan-Michae| Gambi|| and James B|ake. Also entered in the tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), currently at No. 25, two-time Millennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion Ricardo Mel|o (Brazil). The tournament sti|| holds two wildcards that can be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks |eading up to the event.
