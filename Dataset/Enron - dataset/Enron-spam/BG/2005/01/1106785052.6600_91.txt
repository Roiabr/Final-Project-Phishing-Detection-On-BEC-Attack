NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mil|ennium Nationa| Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in Match Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the Millennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

Mi|lennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into acquisition negotiations.

Both |oca| De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two entities. "Basically we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-alone companies," said Robert McAllister, CEO & President of Mil|ennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, "We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and believe that there could be a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McA||ister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for both Mi||ennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is consistent with our overall business plan. It has always been our intent to target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi||ennium sees the Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being able to bring net revenues to MNEI's bottom line. MNEI sees both the internationa| television audience and the abi|ity to attract a Fortune 50O as a potential source of even greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the dea| to be consummated in this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi|lennium ITC inc|udes top Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James Blake. Also entered in the tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, two-time Mi||ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending champion Ricardo Me|lo (Brazil). The tournament still holds two wildcards that can be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
