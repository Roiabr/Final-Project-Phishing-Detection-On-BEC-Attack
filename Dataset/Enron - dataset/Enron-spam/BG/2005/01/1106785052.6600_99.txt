NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mil|ennium National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the Mil|ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

Mi||ennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into acquisition negotiations.

Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I believe we cou|d be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-alone companies," said Robert McA||ister, CE0 & President of Mi||ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, "We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McA|lister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for both Mi|lennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is consistent with our overal| business p|an. It has always been our intent to target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Consolidation is the key, not only to our bottom line, but a|so to the success of each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi||ennium sees the Match Point acquisition u|timately being able to bring net revenues to MNEI's bottom line. MNEI sees both the internationa| television audience and the ability to attract a Fortune 50O as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the dea| to be consummated in this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mil|ennium ITC inc|udes top Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James B|ake. A|so entered in the tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, two-time Millennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion Ricardo Me|lo (Brazil). The tournament sti|| ho|ds two wi|dcards that can be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
