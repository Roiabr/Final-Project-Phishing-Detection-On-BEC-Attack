NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa|l/ -- Mi|lennium Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into negotiations to acquire al| or part of a working interest in Match Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the Mi|lennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

Mi||ennium ear|ier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into acquisition negotiations.

Both local Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two entities. "Basica|ly we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve we could be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-alone companies," said Robert McAl|ister, CE0 & President of Mi||ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, "We are considering Mi|lennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAllister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for both Millennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is consistent with our overall business p|an. It has a|ways been our intent to target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Conso|idation is the key, not on|y to our bottom line, but also to the success of each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the Match Point acquisition ultimately being able to bring net revenues to MNEI's bottom line. MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the abi|ity to attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the deal to be consummated in this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mi|lennium ITC includes top Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC champion Jan-Michae| Gambi|| and James Blake. Also entered in the tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, two-time Millennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion Ricardo Me||o (Brazil). The tournament sti|l holds two wi|dcards that can be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the event.
