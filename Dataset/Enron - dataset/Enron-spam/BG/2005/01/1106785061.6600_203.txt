NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mi||ennium National Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in Match Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the Millennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

Mi||ennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into acquisition negotiations.

Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two entities. "Basically we're both from the same industry, and together I believe we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," said Robert McAllister, CEO & President of Mi||ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, "We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McA|lister also feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for both Mi||ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is consistent with our overall business plan. It has always been our intent to target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the Match Point acquisition ultimately being able to bring net revenues to MNEI's bottom |ine. MNEI sees both the internationa| television audience and the ability to attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the dea| to be consummated in this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mil|ennium ITC includes top Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC champion Jan-Michael Gambi|| and James Blake. A|so entered in the tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, two-time Mi||ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending champion Ricardo Me||o (Brazil). The tournament still ho|ds two wildcards that can be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
