              How are you doing? How's life been treating you? How's work? 
What's been keeping you busy lately? I hope this email finds all of you in 
good health. :-)
              I'm currently on my one year training in Burma. Another 1 year 
to go.

              Wishing you a Merry Christmas (for Christians) and A Happy 
Holiday (for non-Christians).

attached are pictures I got from the net, the first Prince of Tennis (really good!!!!!), 
the second to get you into a festive mood (hope it works! ) :-)

Hope to hear from you soon.

All the best,
Damon :-)</font></P>
