I was surfing the net and came across your website. I wanted to know if you were interested in exchanging links with my site, The Menopause and Black Cohosh Center. You will find nearly a hundred articles and other scientific resources on menopause and black cohosh, as well as other female (and male!) health issues. My site deals with everything from the basic symptoms of menopause to the dangers of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). For example, did you know why women on HRT develop invasive breast cancer, heart disease and strokes at a rate far higher than the average woman who is not on HRT? These are the kind of questions that I would like visitors to be able to get the real answers to. This information is available completely free of charge and I do not sell any advertising on this site. If you are interested in exchanging links please let me know where your link is located and I will add your link to the links page within 24 hours.

For your convenience, I have already written a sample byline and included the HTML code below.

At the <a href="http://www.menopause-black-cohosh.org">Menopause</a> and <a href="http://www.menopause-black-cohosh.org">Black Cohosh</a> center, you can get up-to-date information on menopause and black cohosh, hormone replacement therapy and the latest menopause research.

Please email me and tell me where my link is located and where you would like yours to appear. If you wish, let me know what description I should add for your site and I will add it as well.

In Health,
