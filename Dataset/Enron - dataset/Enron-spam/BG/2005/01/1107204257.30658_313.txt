From the office of:
Marcus Dafe:
Department  of Foreign Operations:
Union Bank Nigeria Plc:
 
Dear Sir/Ma,
 
My name is Dr MARCUS DAFE, and I work in the International operation 
department of Union Bank here in Nigeria. On a routine 
inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of ($

25,000.000 USD) Twenty Five million United States Dollars) on further 
discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has 
long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account.
I decided to seek ways through which to transfer this money out of the 
bank and out the country too.
 
 
The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former 
operator of the A/C is a foreigner and from Iraq in particular and I am

certainly sure that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the 
claim 
of this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims 
to the account Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in this 
transaction.
I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this 
money, But you will need to open an account where this can be 
transferred.
 
If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including 
full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for 
utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the 
future 
of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached. 
I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due 
process is followed accordingly. Finally I will give you 25% for your 
corporation.
 
 
I will please wish you keep this transaction secrect as i am hoping to 
retire with my share of this money at the end of the transaction which 
will be when this money is safely in your account.
You might even have to advise me on possiblities of investment in your 
country or elsewhere of our choice.
Reply me immediately to enable me proceed with you.(marcusdafe@yahoo.co.i=
n.)
 
Yours,
Dr Marcus Dafe.
