NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa|l/ -- Millennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi|lennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Millennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basica|ly we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve 
we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McAl|ister, CE0 & President of Mi||ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and believe that there could be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAl|ister also feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mil|ennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|l business plan. It has a|ways been our intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the international television audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 500 as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi|lennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambi|| and James B|ake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, two-time 
Mi|lennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me|lo (Brazil). The tournament stil| ho|ds two wildcards that can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the event.
