NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Millennium 
National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi||ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Millennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |ocal Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve 
we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CE0 & President of Mi|lennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and believe that there could be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAllister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Millennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|| business plan. It has always been our intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi||ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 5OO as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mi|lennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambi|l and James Blake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, two-time 
Mil|ennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mello (Brazil). The tournament sti|| holds two wildcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
