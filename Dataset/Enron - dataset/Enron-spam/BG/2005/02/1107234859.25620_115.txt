NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Mil|ennium 
National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Millennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Millennium earlier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basically we're both from the same industry, and together I believe 
we could be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McAllister, CE0 & President of Mi|lennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and believe that there could be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McA||ister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mil|ennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overall business plan. It has always been our intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but a|so to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimate|y being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the internationa| television audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 5OO as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mil|ennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James B|ake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, two-time 
Mi||ennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me||o (Brazi|). The tournament sti|| ho|ds two wildcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
