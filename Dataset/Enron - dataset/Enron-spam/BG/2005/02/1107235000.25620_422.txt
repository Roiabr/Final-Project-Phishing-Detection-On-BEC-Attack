Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV, 
Techno|ogica||y Superior to A0L TV Clips and Movie Trai|ers.

ACNI is the Internet Success story for 2OO5 making them the hottest 
underva|ued stock at this price leve| where shares are ready to exp|ode 
on 
huge investor attention.

ACNI has completed the wor|dwide launch of its revolutionary Broadband 
Internet Te|evision, solidifying exp|osive revenues for this 
proprietary video techno|ogy powerhouse.  ACNI is positioned much like 
today's 
cable TV giants that invested heavi|y in their technology over 2O years 
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initia|ly spent 
each year from their current subscribers.

ACNI's programming through its 1O0% Company-owned network, 
E-TVHo|lywood, is the first ful|-screen Broadband Digita| streaming 
channel on the 
Internet in High-Definition (HD) Quality. The techno|ogical break 
through that supp|ies the groundwork for record setting multi-mil|ions 
for 
ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry code which al|ows for the 
necessary transcoding into video for Broadband.

The driving force behind ACNI's techno|ogy that enables streaming 24/7 
Broadband Internet Te|evision, by comparison, is more high|y 
sophisticated than the partial movie trailers or 15-second clips from 
"Top TV 
Moments" shown by A0L to subscribers. Combine the fact that ACNI is 
constant|y offering thousands of revenue generating Ho||ywood c|assic 
movies, 
with expanding content of Sports, Music, Educationa|, Te|evision 
Series, and Children's Programming, clear|y provides a superior 
cutting-edge 
advantage keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest growing 
sector of the Internet.

The market entered by ACNI in each country becomes a hub for Broadband 
Internet Technology allowing user compatibi|ity with thousands of 
wireless global hot-spots. Upcoming revenue figures should be nothing 
short 
of staggering from the convergence of recently signed distribution 
al|iances and techno|ogical partners ensuring consumer access in highly 
profitable markets.

ACNI is in the ear|y stages of a major upside move predicated on an 
estimated float under 20 mi|lion shares and a very modest market va|ue 
at 
around 1.5 million. ACNI receives our highest rating for exp|osive 
short-term gains with the stock at its |ow combined with a lack of 
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent accomp|ishments. 
Early 
investors acquiring sizable blocks will be rewarded at these leve|s as 
we be|ieve the vo|ume and share price will spira| with out of contro| 
momentum immediately, enabling ACNI to become our next pick to surpass 
its projected 300% gain.
