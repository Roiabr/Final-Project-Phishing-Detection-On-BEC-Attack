Branches all over the world) 
SOURCE OF FUNDS:

I have a profiling amount in an excess of US$100.5M, which I seek your
Partnership in accommodating for me. You will be rewarded with 4% of 
The total sum for your partnership. Can you be my partner on this?  
INTRODUCTION OF MY SELF As a personal consultant to him, authority 
Was handed over to me in transfer of money of an American oil merchant 
For his last oil deal with my boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

Already the funds have left the shore of Russia to an European private 
Bank where the final crediting is expected to be carried out.
While I was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his
Involvement in politics by financing the leading 
And opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces,
Led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party 
Led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin 
Second
Tenure as Russian president.

http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/13/51215.html  

YOUR ROLE: All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the 
Above quoted 
Sum and I will re-profile the funds with your name, which will enable 
The
European bank transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this
Sum to relocate to American continent and never to be connected to any 
Of Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates. The transaction has to be 
Concluded 
In 2 weeks before Mikhail Khodorkovsky is out on bail. As
Soon as I confirm your readiness to conclude the transaction with me, I 
Will provide you with the details.
Thank you very much
