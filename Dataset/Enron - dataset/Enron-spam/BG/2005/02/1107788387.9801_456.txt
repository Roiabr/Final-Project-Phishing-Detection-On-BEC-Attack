A positive attitude will not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort. An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools. Begin doing what you want to do now. We are not living in eternity. We have only this moment, sparkling like a star in our hand and melting like a snowflake. Life is a waste of time, time is a waste of life, so get wasted all of the time and have the time of your life. No elected body is the country, we are the country. You and me. Us. It can only stay that way as long as we care to keep it so. If you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere. Begin doing what you want to do now. We are not living in eternity. We have only this moment, sparkling like a star in our hand and melting like a snowflake. The problem with some people is that when they aren't drunk, they're sober. Everything in excess! To enjoy the flavor of life, take big bites. Moderation is for monks. Who so loves believes the impossible. Those who are willing to sacrifice essential liberties for a little order, will lose both and deserve neither. Give me a woman who loves beer and I will conquer the world. Those who are willing to sacrifice essential liberties for a little order, will lose both and deserve neither. The great thing about television is that if something important happens anywhere in the world, day or night, you can always change the channel. Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value. Treat people as if they were what they ought to be, and you help them to become what they are capable of being. The game of life is not so much in holding a good hand as playing a poor hand well. Blessed is the man who, having nothing to say, abstains from giving us wordy evidence of the fact. You can widen your life by yourself, but to deepen it you need a friend. Each encounter that becomes a friendship turns into a lifeline. One can never have too many, only too many to properly take care of. Take away love and our earth is a tomb. The only time you run out of chances is when you stop taking them. When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we commit no sin, we go to heaven. So, let's all get drunk and go to heaven! Who would give a law to lovers? Love is unto itself a higher law. Memory is a child walking along a seashore. You never can tell what small pebble it will pick up and store away among its treasured things. Everything in excess! To enjoy the flavor of life, take big bites. Moderation is for monks. A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes. Compassion is the antitoxin of the soul: where there is compassion even the most poisonous impulses remain relatively harmless. Touch is the most fundamental sense. A baby experiences it, all over, before he is born and long after he learns to use sight, hearing, or taste, and no human ever ceases to need it. Keep your children short on pocket money - but long on hugs. The problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind. Memory is a child walking along a seashore. You never can tell what small pebble it will pick up and store away among its treasured things. Without question, the greatest invention in the history of mankind is beer. Oh, I grant you that the wheel was also a fine invention, but the wheel does not go nearly as well with pizza. I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day. When a friend is in trouble, don't annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do. Think up something appropriate and do it. Iron rusts from disuse; stagnant water loses its purity and in cold weather becomes frozen; even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind. The great thing about a computer notebook is that no matter how much you stuff into it, it doesn't get bigger or heavier. Not all chemicals are bad. Without chemicals such as hydrogen and oxygen, for example, there would be no way to make water, a vital ingredient in beer. If you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere. 24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case. Coincidence? All right, Brain, I don't like you and you don't like me -- so let's just do this and I'll get back to killing you with beer. The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands in times of challenge and controversy. Touch is the most fundamental sense. A baby experiences it, all over, before he is born and long after he learns to use sight, hearing, or taste, and no human ever ceases to need it. Keep your children short on pocket money - but long on hugs. Iron rusts from disuse; stagnant water loses its purity and in cold weather becomes frozen; even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind. A woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea. Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value. Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut. A book may lie dormant for fifty years or for two thousand years in a forgotten corner of a library, only to reveal, upon being opened, the marvels or the abysses that it contains, or the line that seems to have been written for me alone. In this respect the writer is not different from any other human being: whatever we say or do can have far-reaching consequences. Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life. Love is the beauty of the soul. Can miles truly separate you from friends... If you want to be with someone you love, aren't you already there? Compassion is the antitoxin of the soul: where there is compassion even the most poisonous impulses remain relatively harmless. Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work. Reality is an illusion that occurs due to lack of alcohol. Treat people as if they were what they ought to be, and you help them to become what they are capable of being. When solving problems, dig at the roots instead of just hacking at the leaves. Love is the energy of the soul. Love is what heals the personality. There is nothing that cannot be healed by love. There is nothing but love. Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut. If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer, I bet it makes beer shoot out your nose. Iron rusts from disuse; stagnant water loses its purity and in cold weather becomes frozen; even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind. Always remember that I have taken more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken out of me. Compassion alone stands apart from the continuous traffic between good and evil proceeding within us. The man who says I told you so is making an excuse for not expressing his position clearly in the first place. The best proof of love is trust. Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we commit no sin, we go to heaven. So, let's all get drunk and go to heaven! Why is it drug addicts and computer afficionados are both called users? Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work. Give me a woman who loves beer and I will conquer the world. I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a ... brain operation. You can't be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline. It helps if you have some kind of a football team, or some nuclear weapons, but at the very least you need a beer. A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes. Compassion alone stands apart from the continuous traffic between good and evil proceeding within us. It's not that chocolates are a substitute for love. Love is a substitute for chocolate. Chocolate is, let's face it, far more reliable than a man. The man who says I told you so is making an excuse for not expressing his position clearly in the first place. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. Solitude, if rightly used, becomes not only a privilege but a necessity. Only a superficial soul fears to fraternize with itself. I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day. What the world really needs is more love and less paper work. Very little is needed to make a happy life. It is all within yourself, in your way of thinking. A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes. What contemptible scoundrel has stolen the cork to my lunch? Nothing splendid has ever been achieved except by those who dared believe that something inside them was superior to circumstances. Love takes up where knowledge leaves off. Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies. Hope is like a road in the country: there was never a road, but when many people walk on it, the road comes into existence. All love shifts and changes. I don't know if you can be wholeheartedly in love all the time. The great thing about a computer notebook is that no matter how much you stuff into it, it doesn't get bigger or heavier. I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day. Of cheerfulness, or a good temper - the more it is spent, the more of it remains.
