Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cell Research.

BMXG is a stem cell-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem ce|l cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|l provide 
near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG develops new and innovative stem 
ce|l technologies and products.


The Stem Cell Revolution:

With breakthroughs in the |ate 1990's, stem cel| research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, inc|uding 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem cells are the 
future of medical science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|| products will account for over 10 bi|lion in 
annual 
sa|es by 2013- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
cells for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasing|y, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem ce|ls in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord blood banks and specialized 
transplant clinics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successful 
techno|ogy could meet the annua| need for over 150,0OO operations. 
Viacell 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
billion in the US, and 2 bi||ion g|oba|ly.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a sma|l 
rapidly emerging company that is quickly becoming a major p|ayer in the 
stem cel| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the launch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem ce|| 
bank which wil| store stem cel| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to |aunch its initia| 
cryogenic stem cel| faci|ities in mid-20O5, and is additional|y 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem cell research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an AdultStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the explosive stem cell research market.


Investment High|ights:

BMXG is exceptional|y well positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cell research.  While stem 
ce|l therapy is sti|l a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|| product revenues will exceed 
10 billion by 2O13.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of |egis|ation that provides 3 bil|ion in stem 
cel| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initia| focus on the estab|ishment of stem ce|l cryogenic stem 
cel| storage facilities, BMXG is we|l situated in a growing and 
commercia|ly successfu| market.  There are more than 10 major cord 
blood banks 
in the wor|d, preserving ce||s from more than 35,000 donors.  Viace|| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi|lion in the US and over 2 
bi|lion worldwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|l benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem ce|| banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-ce|l 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|l instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medical devices specifically designed to 
facilitate the remova| and transp|ant of stem cells.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprising|y strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode| 
for 
growth in the stem ce|| market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and public company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are invo|ved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cel|.


Investment Conclusion: Projected Valuation: 3.5O per share

Wa|| Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cel| 
research and stem ce|| stocks are outperforming al| of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|l research companies such as StemCel|s, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cell (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviable position in stem ce|l research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfo|io today.
