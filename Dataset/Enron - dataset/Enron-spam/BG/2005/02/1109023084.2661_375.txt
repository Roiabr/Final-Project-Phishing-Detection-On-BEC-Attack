Mr Victor Osadolor
Bank Of The North Plc,
123 Amadubelo Way,
Kaduna, Kaduna State,
P.M.B 3456,
Kaduna- Ng,Africa.
Do remember to send your reply to this mail
Box:obikapaul1969@uymail.com,


Attn: MD/CEO,
l am Mr VictorOsadolor I have urgent and very
confidential business proposal for you. On June 6,
1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor, Mr.
Charles Balassi with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for
twelve calendar months, valued at
US$14,600,000.00(Fourteen Million Six Hundred Thousand
Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. 

I sent a rountine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply.After a month,we sent a
reminder and finally we discovered from his contract
employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
that he died in the plane crash of 31 October 199
9[with Egyptian 990] with other passengers aboaed as
you can confirm it yourself via the website below: 

www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html 

On further investigation, i found out that he died
without making a WILL, and attempts to trace his next
of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Balassi
did not declare any next of kin or relations in a
ll his official documents, including his bank deposit
paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$14,600,000.00 is
still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over
with the pricipal sum at the end of each year. No one
will ever come forward to claim it.

According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of
(five)years, the money will revert to the ownership of
the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds. Consequently,my proposal is that i will like
you as a foreigner to stand as the next of k
in to Mr. Charles Balassi so that the fruit of this
old man's labour will not get into the hands of some
corrupt Government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately
your full name and address so that the Attorney will
prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which
will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall
employ the service of two attorney for the 
drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favour for the
transfer. 

Any bank account in any part of the world which you
will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. 

The money will be paid into your account for us to
share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is
no risk at all, the paperwork for this transaction
will be done by the attorney and my position as the
Branch Manager guarantees the successful exec
ution of ths transaction. If you are interested,please
reply immediately via this private email address,upon
your responce,i shall provide you with more details
and relevant documents that will help you understand
the transaction. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable
for both of us because i shall require your assitance
to invest my share in your country. 
Please upon the reciept of this mail message, send to
me the following,to enable me start the process of the
funds into your bank account: 

1. Your full Name
2. Your private Telephone and fax numbers 
3. Your bank account detalis

Immediately I recieve a mail indicating your interest
I shall communicate to you. 
Thanks and regards,
