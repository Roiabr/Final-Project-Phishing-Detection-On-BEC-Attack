Subject: I need your assistance to be presented as the Next of kin.   

I am Mr. Frank Uche a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney to Mr. A J B Martin a national of your country, who is working in our oil industry. On may 14th 2002, he along with his family of a wife and 2 kids perished in a plane crash that involved 144 others with our then sports minister Late Ishaya Mark Aku in an EAS airline in Kano nothern Nigeria. Here in after shall be referred to as my client.  
All occupants of the plane unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives.  
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you.  
I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged. 
Particularly, the finance company where the deceased had an account valued at about USD18.6 million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten official working days.  
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you came from his country so that the proceeds of this account valued at USD18.6 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money.  
60% to me and 40% to you I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.  
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by my personalemail fkuche1@latinmail.com and send to me your full names, telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this transaction.
