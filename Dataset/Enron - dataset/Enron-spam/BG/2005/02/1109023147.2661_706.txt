Family. The Swiss Government Has Already Frozen All 
The Accounts Of The Family In Switzerland,
And Some Other Countries Would Soon Follow To Do 
The Same. This Bid By Some Government Officials

Handled In Phases And The First Phase Will Involve 
The Moving Of Us$25,000,000.00( Twenty Five Million 
United States Dollars ).

Necessary Details As To How We Intend To Carry Out
The Whole Transaction. Please, Do Not Entertain Any
Fears,As All Necessary Modalities Are In Place,
And I Assure You Of All Success And Safety In 
This Transaction.

Please, This Transaction Requires Absolute
Confidentiality And You Would Be Expected To
