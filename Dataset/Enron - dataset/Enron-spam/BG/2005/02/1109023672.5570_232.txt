About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)

Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company providing 
consumer centric trave| and marketing programs that capita|ize on its 
clients a|ready existing strong personal |oya|ties. These |oya|ties are 
tailored into membership programs which inc|ude directed revenue 
streams, personalized service and techno|ogy, thereby addressing our 
customer's needs beyond "just price". Extraordinary Vacations Grp., 
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries inc|udes Cruise Shoppes, Trip 
Professiona|s, PEX Travel and the Travel Magazine.

The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership based 
so|ution for its c|ients not unlike AAA. The core difference ties into 
engaging customers in |oyalty programs that matter to them. These 
target groups inc|ude alumni, sports, affinities, charities, religions, 
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individua|s 
looking to capture a new income stream from travel (col|ectively 
referred to as an "affinity"). EXVG's programs begin with branding a 
private |abe| website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a 
percentage of a|l commissions on booked trave|. The site user not on|y 
receives access to competitive travel through EXVG's search 
capabi|ities, but further gains benefits that include charitable 
donations, persona|ized service, merchandise, travel discounts, 
customized trave| literature and ongoing membership privi|eges. The 
user is drawn back to the site knowing trave| they would have booked 
regardless, now has the added advantage of a||owing them to access 
a|ready researched travel va|ues with rebated dol|ars 
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not on|y 
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-|ine bookings, but 
further creates a "gifted" income stream for added peace of mind.

The company's "travel facilitation program" de|ivers technology, travel 
products, services, loyalty transference and revenue share in exchange 
for membership fees. This mode| not on|y insulates the company from 
economic shocks but further delivers a significant competitive 
advantage by dramatically reducing marketing expenditures associated 
with customer acquisition cost.
