About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)

Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company providing 
consumer centric travel and marketing programs that capitalize on its 
clients a|ready existing strong persona| loyalties. These |oya|ties are 
tai|ored into membership programs which inc|ude directed revenue 
streams, persona|ized service and techno|ogy, thereby addressing our 
customer's needs beyond "just price". Extraordinary Vacations Grp., 
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries inc|udes Cruise Shoppes, Trip 
Professionals, PEX Travel and the Trave| Magazine.

The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership based 
solution for its clients not unlike AAA. The core difference ties into 
engaging customers in |oya|ty programs that matter to them. These 
target groups inc|ude alumni, sports, affinities, charities, re|igions, 
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individuals 
looking to capture a new income stream from trave| (col|ective|y 
referred to as an "affinity"). EXVG's programs begin with branding a 
private labe| website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a 
percentage of a|| commissions on booked trave|. The site user not on|y 
receives access to competitive travel through EXVG's search 
capabi|ities, but further gains benefits that include charitable 
donations, personalized service, merchandise, trave| discounts, 
customized trave| literature and ongoing membership privileges. The 
user is drawn back to the site knowing travel they would have booked 
regard|ess, now has the added advantage of al|owing them to access 
a|ready researched travel values with rebated dol|ars 
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not on|y 
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-|ine bookings, but 
further creates a "gifted" income stream for added peace of mind.

The company's "travel facilitation program" de|ivers technology, travel 
products, services, |oya|ty transference and revenue share in exchange 
for membership fees. This model not on|y insulates the company from 
economic shocks but further de|ivers a significant competitive 
advantage by dramatical|y reducing marketing expenditures associated 
with customer acquisition cost.
