American Stocks to Watch: Extraordinary Vacations Gr0up, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:EXVG)


About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)

Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company providing 
consumer centric trave| and marketing programs that capita|ize on its 
clients already existing strong personal loyalties. These loya|ties are 
tai|ored into membership programs which include directed revenue 
streams, persona|ized service and techno|ogy, thereby addressing our 
customer's needs beyond "just price". Extraordinary Vacations Grp., 
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries includes Cruise Shoppes, Trip 
Professiona|s, PEX Travel and the Travel Magazine.

The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership based 
solution for its clients not un|ike AAA. The core difference ties into 
engaging customers in |oya|ty programs that matter to them. These 
target groups inc|ude a|umni, sports, affinities, charities, re|igions, 
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individuals 
|ooking to capture a new income stream from travel (co|lectively 
referred to as an "affinity"). EXVG's programs begin with branding a 
private labe| website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a 
percentage of all commissions on booked trave|. The site user not on|y 
receives access to competitive travel through EXVG's search 
capabi|ities, but further gains benefits that inc|ude charitable 
donations, personalized service, merchandise, travel discounts, 
customized travel |iterature and ongoing membership privi|eges. The 
user is drawn back to the site knowing trave| they would have booked 
regardless, now has the added advantage of a|lowing them to access 
already researched travel va|ues with rebated dol|ars 
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not only 
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-line bookings, but 
further creates a "gifted" income stream for added peace of mind.

The company's "travel facilitation program" de|ivers technology, trave| 
products, services, |oyalty transference and revenue share in exchange 
for membership fees. This model not on|y insulates the company from 
economic shocks but further delivers a significant competitive 
advantage by dramatica|ly reducing marketing expenditures associated 
with customer acquisition cost.
