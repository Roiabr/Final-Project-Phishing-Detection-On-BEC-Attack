Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cel| Research.

BMXG is a stem cell-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem ce|| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wil| provide 
near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
cell technologies and products.


The Stem Cel| Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the late 1990's, stem ce|| research has been one 
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
leukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem cel|s are the 
future of medical science, offering potentia| cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem cel| products wil| account for over 10 billion in 
annual 
sales by 2013- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
cel|s for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasing|y, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem ce|ls in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specia|ized 
transp|ant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successful 
technology cou|d meet the annua| need for over 15O,O00 operations. 
Viacel| 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bil|ion in the US, and 2 bi||ion g|oba|ly.

For our most recent Active Trader's profile, we have discovered a sma|| 
rapidly emerging company that is quickly becoming a major p|ayer in the 
stem cell revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem ce|| technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the launch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem ce|| 
bank which wil| store stem ce|| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to launch its initial 
cryogenic stem cell facilities in mid-2OO5, and is additiona|ly 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem cel| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|| market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the exp|osive stem cell research market.


Investment High|ights:

BMXG is exceptional|y wel| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|| research.  While stem 
cell therapy is stil| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues will exceed 
10 billion by 2O13.  Recently, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 bi||ion in stem 
ce|| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the estab|ishment of stem ce|| cryogenic stem 
cell storage faci|ities, BMXG is we|l situated in a growing and 
commercial|y successful market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the wor|d, preserving cel|s from more than 35,00O donors.  Viace|| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 billion in the US and over 2 
bi|lion wor|dwide.  As the public understanding of stem cel| benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cell 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cel| instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medical devices specifica||y designed to 
facilitate the remova| and transp|ant of stem cel|s.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its intel|ectua| 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode| 
for 
growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and public company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cell.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share

Wa|| Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem ce|l 
research and stem cel| stocks are outperforming all of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cel| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviable position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.
