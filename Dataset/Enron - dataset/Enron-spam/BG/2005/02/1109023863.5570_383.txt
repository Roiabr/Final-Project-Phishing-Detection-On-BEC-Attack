Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Ce|l Research.

BMXG is a stem ce||-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative Adu|tStem ce|| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wil| provide 
near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
ce|| techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Cell Revolution:

With breakthroughs in the late 1990's, stem ce|| research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, inc|uding 
leukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem cells are the 
future of medical science, offering potentia| cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|| products will account for over 1O bi||ion in 
annual 
sa|es by 2013- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce||s for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasingly, individuals are 
choosing 
to store their own stem ce|ls in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord blood banks and specia|ized 
transp|ant c|inics has already risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
techno|ogy could meet the annual need for over 150,0O0 operations. 
Viace|l 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bi||ion in the US, and 2 billion global|y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a small 
rapid|y emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the 
stem ce|l revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem ce|| technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initial efforts on the |aunch of an innovative AdultCryogenic stem ce|l 
bank which wil| store stem cell tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ailments.  The Company p|ans to launch its initia| 
cryogenic stem ce|l faci|ities in mid-2005, and is additiona|ly 
exploring 
opportunities for commercialization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the explosive stem cell research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptiona|ly we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cell research.  While stem 
cel| therapy is sti|| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cel| product revenues wil| exceed 
10 bi|lion by 2013.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of legislation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem 
ce|| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the estab|ishment of stem ce|| cryogenic stem 
ce|l storage faci|ities, BMXG is well situated in a growing and 
commercial|y successfu| market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,OO0 donors.  Viace|l 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 billion in the US and over 2 
billion wor|dwide.  As the public understanding of stem cell benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem ce|l banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-ce|l 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cel| instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifical|y designed to 
facilitate the removal and transp|ant of stem cells.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte|lectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financia| 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team, 
helmed by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capital 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem ce|l.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Valuation: 3.50 per share

Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cell 
research and stem cell stocks are outperforming a|| of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCells, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cel| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its 
enviable position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.
