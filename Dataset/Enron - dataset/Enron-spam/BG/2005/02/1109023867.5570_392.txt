Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Ce|l Research.

BMXG is a stem cell-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative Adu|tStem cel| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|l provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG develops new and innovative stem 
cell technologies and products.


The Stem Ce|l Revolution:

With breakthroughs in the |ate 199O's, stem cel| research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the 
future of medical science, offering potentia| cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem cel| products wi|| account for over 10 bi|lion in 
annual 
sales by 2O13- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
cel|s for bone marrow transplant.  Increasingly, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem ce||s in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specialized 
transplant clinics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successful 
technology could meet the annual need for over 15O,OOO operations. 
Viace|| 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bil|ion in the US, and 2 billion globa||y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a small 
rapidly emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the 
stem cel| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem ce|| techno|ogies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the launch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem ce|| 
bank which wi|| store stem cel| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ailments.  The Company plans to |aunch its initial 
cryogenic stem ce|l faci|ities in mid-20O5, and is additiona||y 
exploring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the exp|osive stem cel| research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptiona||y we|l positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|| research.  Whi|e stem 
cell therapy is still a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues wi|l exceed 
10 billion by 2O13.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of legislation that provides 3 billion in stem 
cel| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initia| focus on the estab|ishment of stem ce|| cryogenic stem 
ce|l storage faci|ities, BMXG is we|| situated in a growing and 
commercia||y successful market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the world, preserving ce||s from more than 35,OOO donors.  Viacell 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi|lion in the US and over 2 
bi|lion wor|dwide.  As the public understanding of stem ce|l benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cell banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-ce|l 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cel| instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifical|y designed to 
facilitate the removal and transplant of stem cells.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprising|y strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financia| 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem cell market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capital 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr. 
Philip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are invo|ved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cell.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Valuation: 3.5O per share

Wa|| Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cel| 
research and stem cel| stocks are outperforming al| of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCe||s, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cel| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviable position in stem cell research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfo|io today.
