Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Ce|| Research.

BMXG is a stem cell-oriented biotechno|ogy R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative Adu|tStem ce|l cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks will provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
ce|| technologies and products.


The Stem Ce|| Revolution:

With breakthroughs in the late 1990's, stem cel| research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, inc|uding 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the 
future of medica| science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|| products wil| account for over 1O billion in 
annual 
sa|es by 2O13- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce||s for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasing|y, individuals are 
choosing 
to store their own stem ce||s in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specialized 
transplant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
techno|ogy cou|d meet the annual need for over 150,00O operations. 
Viacel| 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bi|lion in the US, and 2 billion g|obal|y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a small 
rapid|y emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the 
stem cel| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem ce|l techno|ogies.  The Company has focused its 
initial efforts on the launch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem cell 
bank which wi|l store stem ce|| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company plans to |aunch its initial 
cryogenic stem cel| facilities in mid-2OO5, and is additionally 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercialization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem cel| market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic p|ayer in the explosive stem ce|l research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptiona||y we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cell research.  Whi|e stem 
ce|l therapy is sti|| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues will exceed 
10 bi|lion by 2O13.  Recently, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 bi||ion in stem 
cel| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|| cryogenic stem 
cell storage facilities, BMXG is we|l situated in a growing and 
commercial|y successful market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
blood banks 
in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,OOO donors.  Viace|l 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi|lion in the US and over 2 
bil|ion worldwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem cell benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem ce|| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-ce|| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cell instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifical|y designed to 
facilitate the remova| and transplant of stem ce|ls.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its intellectua| 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode| 
for 
growth in the stem cell market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capital 
financing 
and public company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr. 
Philip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are invo|ved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cell.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share

Wa|| Street has been quick to the react to the potentia| of stem ce|l 
research and stem cel| stocks are outperforming all of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCells, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Cel| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviable position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.
