NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa|l/ -- Mil|ennium 
National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi|lennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Mil|ennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I 
believe 
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-alone companies," 
said Robert McA||ister, CEO & President of Mi|lennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Millennium's offers and be|ieve that there cou|d be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McA||ister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi|lennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overal| business p|an. It has always been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mil|ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 50O as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mi||ennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James B|ake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mi|lennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mello (Brazil). The tournament sti|l holds two wildcards that 
can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the event.
