Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmental|y safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" electricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oi|, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish 
the 
|ocal or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 20O5 a "Blue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.O0). The deal is structured to have 1,3OO GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fulfill a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 5O0 mi|lion kilowatts exists annually, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantia||y 
whi|e providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpal Solid Waste disposa| 
and simu|taneous|y helping China meet its energy needs.

some new PR's forthcoming which wi|| Rocket GEEC. This power-play has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's stil| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wi|l add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
