Hello,

I was looking around the Internet for helpful resources and came across your website. I thought it would make sense to exchange links with your site. My website is a tremendous resource for information on arthritis, glucosamine and joint pain. This informative site doesn't sell anything but instead seeks to educate the public about arthritis and describe just how things like COX-2 drugs can be fatal. There are literally hundreds of articles, clinical research, a discussion forum and simple explanations of scientific findings to explore. Let me know when you have placed your link and I will put yours up in the category of your choice within 24 hours. To save you some time, I have created a sample link and included the HTML code below:

Joint pain is something that nobody should have to live with. Fortunately, information is power. Explore the Glucosamine and Arthritis Center for the latest information on glucosamine, arthritis and joint pain. Read hundreds of articles, "plain english" clinical trial summaries, message board posts and more. 


In Health,
