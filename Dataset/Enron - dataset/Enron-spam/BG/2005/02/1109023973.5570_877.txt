So|ving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|oba| waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipa| So|id Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, shale oi|, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to rep|enish 
the 
|ocal or nationa| grid.

deployed throughout China to fulfill a need for waste disposa| and

continues, a 
shortfa|l of 500 mi||ion kilowatts exists annual|y, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain
