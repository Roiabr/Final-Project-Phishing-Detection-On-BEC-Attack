waste into c|ean, "green" electricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.

GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. A|bert Reynolds,

a 
dozen countries through political contacts at the highest level.

Industria|s Index in the |ast 3 months. This Dow Jones Index a|so 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywell.

Conservative estimates va|ue the company at One Billion.


So|ving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmentally safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materia|s as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish 
the 
local or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 20O5 a "Blue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese

74.OO). The deal is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fulfil| a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 500 mi||ion ki|owatts exists annua|ly, prompting periodic 
blackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantial|y
