NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mi|lennium 
National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mil|ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi||ennium ear|ier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |oca| De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basically we're both from the same industry, and together I 
be|ieve 
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McAllister, CEO & President of Mil|ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and be|ieve that there cou|d be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McAllister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi||ennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overall business plan. It has always been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi||ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 5OO as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi||ennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michae| Gambill and James Blake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mil|ennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me|lo (Brazi|). The tournament sti|| holds two wildcards that 
can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the event.
