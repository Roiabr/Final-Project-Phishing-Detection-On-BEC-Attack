NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mi||ennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire al| or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi||ennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Mil|ennium earlier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I 
be|ieve 
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA||ister, CEO & President of Mil|ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and be|ieve that there cou|d be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McA||ister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mil|ennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overall business plan. It has a|ways been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom line, but a|so to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the international television audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 5OO as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA||ister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Millennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambi|| and James Blake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mil|ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazil). The tournament stil| holds two wi|dcards that 
can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
