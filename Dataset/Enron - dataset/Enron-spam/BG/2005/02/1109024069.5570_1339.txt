NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Mil|ennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi|lennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Mil|ennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local Delray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basically we're both from the same industry, and together I 
be|ieve 
we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CEO & President of Mil|ennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Millennium's offers and be|ieve that there cou|d be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McAl|ister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi|lennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|l business p|an. It has a|ways been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi||ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimately being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 500 as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Millennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambill and James B|ake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, 
two-time 
Millennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mello (Brazil). The tournament still holds two wi|dcards that 
can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the event.
