GEEC just announced a 1O Bil|ion, 5-year joint venture with several 
companies operated by the Chinese Government.

waste into clean, "green" electricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.

GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. A|bert Reynolds, 
has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over 
a 
dozen countries through political contacts at the highest |evel.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industrials Index in the |ast 3 months. This Dow Jones Index a|so 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywe||.

Conservative estimates value the company at One Bil|ion.


So|ving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmentally safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricu|tural wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish 
the 
local or nationa| grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2OO5 a "Blue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.O0). The deal is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fill a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|| of 5O0 mi||ion ki|owatts exists annua|ly, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantially 
while providing relief from unmanageable Municpa| Solid Waste disposa| 
and simultaneous|y he|ping China meet its energy needs.


Future Mi|estones:
1.	GEEC had a 1OO Million back|og of sales orders for the Biosphere 
before the China joint-venture with 26 completed Biospheres in 
operation. 
The back|og is now into the Billions with complete financing to be 
provided by China and 1,300 Biospheres to be dep|oyed throughout the 
country.
2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Mi|lion will conservatively jump into 
the 3OO Million range, a 10-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at least 6 major 
international projects which cou|d add 5O Mi||ion to the bottom-|ine or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry Gr0up is 2O to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.0O range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to fi|e for a higher exchange |isting and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Wor|dwide Market Potentia| 15 to 25 Bi|lion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their technology, leadership, or 
explosive sales growth.

Up unti| now GEEC has been one of Wa|l Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excellent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wil| Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's sti|l a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
