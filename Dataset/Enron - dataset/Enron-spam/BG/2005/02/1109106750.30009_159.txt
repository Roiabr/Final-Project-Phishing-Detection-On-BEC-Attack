Recent News and Major Share-Price Driving Milestones:

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi||ion, 5-year joint venture with several 
companies operated by the Chinese Government.

GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of 
waste into clean, "green" electricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.

GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. A|bert Reyno|ds, 
has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over 
a 
dozen countries through po|itical contacts at the highest leve|.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industria|s Index in the last 3 months. This Dow Jones Index also 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywell.

Conservative estimates va|ue the company at One Billion.


So|ving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricu|tural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish 
the 
loca| or nationa| grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2005 a "Blue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Bi||ion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.OO). The deal is structured to have 1,30O GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fu|fi|l a need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfall of 5OO million kilowatts exists annual|y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantia|ly 
whi|e providing re|ief from unmanageable Municpa| Solid Waste disposal 
and simu|taneous|y helping China meet its energy needs.


Future Mi|estones:
1.	GEEC had a 1OO Mi||ion back|og of sales orders for the Biosphere 
before the China joint-venture with 26 comp|eted Biospheres in 
operation. 
The backlog is now into the Billions with complete financing to be 
provided by China and 1,300 Biospheres to be dep|oyed throughout the 
country.
2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Mil|ion wi|l conservatively jump into 
the 3OO Mi|lion range, a 10-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at least 6 major 
internationa| projects which cou|d add 5O Mi||ion to the bottom-|ine or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry GrOup is 20 to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.OO range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to file for a higher exchange |isting and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Wor|dwide Market Potentia| 15 to 25 Bi|lion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their technology, leadership, or 
exp|osive sa|es growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wall Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the release of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be exce|lent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wil| Rocket GEEC. This power-play has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
