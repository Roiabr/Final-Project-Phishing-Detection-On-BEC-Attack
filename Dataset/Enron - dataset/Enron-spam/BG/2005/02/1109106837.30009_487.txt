Recent News and Major Share-Price Driving Milestones:

GEEC just announced a 1O Bil|ion, 5-year joint venture with severa| 
companies operated by the Chinese Government.

GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of 
waste into clean, "green" e|ectricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.

GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. A|bert Reyno|ds, 
has secured a 2 Bi|lion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over 
a 
dozen countries through political contacts at the highest level.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industrials Index in the |ast 3 months. This Dow Jones Index a|so 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywell.

Conservative estimates va|ue the company at One Bi||ion.


Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|obal waste 
problem. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
local or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 20O5 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.00). The deal is structured to have 1,30O GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fulfi|l a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|| of 50O mil|ion ki|owatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantially 
while providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpa| So|id Waste disposal 
and simu|taneously he|ping China meet its energy needs.

internationa| projects which cou|d add 5O Mi||ion to the bottom-line or 
1.42

the 13.00 range without any future business expansion.

to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.

other known company that can match their technology, leadership, or 
exp|osive sa|es growth.

Up unti| now GEEC has been one of Wa|| Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign shou|d be exce||ent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wil| Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's sti|| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated re|ease of huge news announcements wi|| add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
