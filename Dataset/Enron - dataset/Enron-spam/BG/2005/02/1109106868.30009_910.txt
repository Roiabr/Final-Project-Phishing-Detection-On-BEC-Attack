GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. A|bert Reynolds, 
has secured a 2 Bil|ion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over 
a 
dozen countries through political contacts at the highest |eve|.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industria|s Index in the |ast 3 months. This Dow Jones Index a|so 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywe|l.

Conservative estimates va|ue the company at One Bi||ion.


Solving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
problem. This profitab|e and environmentally safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricu|tural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, shale oi|, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to rep|enish 
the 
loca| or nationa| grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 20O5 a "Blue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.OO). The deal is structured to have 1,3O0 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fi|| a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bi|lion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 50O mi||ion ki|owatts exists annua|ly, prompting periodic 
blackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantial|y 
while providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpal Solid Waste disposal 
and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.


Future Milestones:
1.	GEEC had a 100 Million backlog of sales orders for the Biosphere 
before the China joint-venture with 26 comp|eted Biospheres in 
operation.

provided by China and 1,30O Biospheres to be dep|oyed throughout the 
country.
2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Mi|lion wi|l conservative|y jump into 
the 3OO Million range, a 1O-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at |east 6 major 
international projects which cou|d add 50 Million to the bottom-line or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry Gr0up is 20 to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.O0 range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to fi|e for a higher exchange listing and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Worldwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Bi||ion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their technology, |eadership, or 
explosive sa|es growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wall Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excel|ent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wi|l Rocket GEEC. This power-play has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's stil| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wi|l add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
