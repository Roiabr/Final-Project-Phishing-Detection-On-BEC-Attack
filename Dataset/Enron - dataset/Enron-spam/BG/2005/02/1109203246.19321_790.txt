FROM THE DESK OF HAJIA MARIAM ABACHA (MRS)

Dear Friend ,

This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address. Please I got your name and address through a commercial publication via Internet courtesy of S.A.I.E. during my desperate search for someone that could honestly and confidentially assist me by serving as my trustee. 

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen. Sanni Abacha former Nigerian Military Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of  Cardiac Arrest. Since after my husband?s death my family is under restriction of movement and that not withstanding, we are being molested, policed and our Bank Account both here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian Civilian Government.

Furthermore, my elder son is in detention by the Nigerian Government  for more interrogation about my husband?s assists and some vital documents.
Following the recent discovery of my husband?s Bank Account by the Nigerian Government with Swiss Bank in which the huge sum of US$700Million and DM450Milllion was logged. I therefore decided to contact you in confidence that I was able to move out the sum of US$25Million Dollars, which was secretly lodged in a trunk box and deposited with a Security Company as materials of Inheritance.

I therefore personally, appeal to you seriously and religiously for  your urgent assistance to move this money into your country where I believe it will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by the Nigerian Government.
You will be contacted by my family Attorney AKINTOLA JOHNSON and my lawyer shall arrange with you for a face to face meeting outside Nigerian, in order to liaise with you toward effective completion of this transaction.


However, arrangements have been put in place to move this money out of  the country in a secret vault through a diplomatic security company, as  soon as you indicate your interest, forward to my lawyer your Telephone Number, Fax Number and your Postal Address so that he can send to you the Certificate of Deposit and other necessary documents, so that you can help to claim the luggage.

Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum while  70% is to be held on trust by you until we decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian Government.
Please reply to this mail urgently and treat with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.

Best Regards,
Hajia Mariam abacha(Mrs.)
