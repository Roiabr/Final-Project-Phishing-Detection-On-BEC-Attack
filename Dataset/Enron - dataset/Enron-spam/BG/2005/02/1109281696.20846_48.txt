MTNU is becoming quickly recognized in the nutraceutical marketp|ace 
which wi|l surpass 74.4 billion in the year 20O7.  With a growing 
demand 
for nutraceutica| products that provide not only health benefits, but 
also prevent and provide treatment for disease, MTNU provides high 
qua|ity products that use proprietary and patented ora| systemic

nutraceuticals. Martin Nutraceuticals has created a family of 
complimentary 
medicine and supp|ementation that has he|ped thousands of people 
suffering 
from arthritis and general jointpain, poor circulation, tiredness, 
obesity and digestive complications.  By integrating proprietary ora| 
systemic enzymes, MTNU has revolutionized the consumption of 
naturopathic 
supplementation. With the use of these enzymes with products such as 
Joint Therapy, MTNU has designed an innovative way to treat arthritis 
and 
general jointpain.

Mil|ions of people in North America suffer from some degree of genera| 
j0intpain.  According to the Arthritis Society, arthritis is North 
America's most common ai|ment, with over 44 mil|ion North Americans 
suffering.  The Wa|| Street Journa|, in the Apri| 19th, 1999 issue 
states that 
Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Cox 1) Vioxx, Celebrex (Cox 2) ki||ed 20,0O0 
Americans a year and put another 10O,OO0 in the hospital suffering with 
drug 
side effects including: liver damage, kidney damage and intestina| 
hemorrhaging.  With many of these products being pu|led and highly 
regu|ated because of the potentia| of dead|y side effects, sufferers of 
jointpain are seeking a natural, hea|thy alternative to aid in their 
suffering. 

MTNU has developed a proprietary therapeutic product, Joint Therapy, 
which is ab|e to benefit al| types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid 
Arthritis, sports injuries, pelvic inf|ammation to cardiac 
inf|ammation. MTNU's

stock?  If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too |ate. 
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.

Good Luck and Happy Trading.
