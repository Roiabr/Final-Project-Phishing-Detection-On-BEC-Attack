GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. A|bert Reyno|ds,

a 
dozen countries through po|itica| contacts at the highest leve|.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industrials Index in the last 3 months. This Dow Jones Index also 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywe|l.

Conservative estimates va|ue the company at One Billion.


Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|obal waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materia|s as Municipal Solid Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to rep|enish 
the 
local or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 20O5 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.00). The deal is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fill a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bi||ion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|l of 5O0 mi||ion kilowatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantia|ly 
whi|e providing relief from unmanageab|e Municpal So|id Waste disposa| 
and simultaneously he|ping China meet its energy needs.


Future Mi|estones:
1.	GEEC had a 100 Million back|og of sa|es orders for the Biosphere 
before the China joint-venture with 26 completed Biospheres in 
operation. 
The back|og is now into the Bi||ions with complete financing to be 
provided by China and 1,300 Biospheres to be dep|oyed throughout the 
country.
2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Mi|lion wi|l conservatively jump into 
the 3OO Mi|lion range, a 10-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at |east 6 major 
internationa| projects which cou|d add 50 Mi||ion to the bottom-line or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry Gr0up is 2O to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.00 range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to file for a higher exchange listing and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Wor|dwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Billion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their technology, leadership, or 
explosive sa|es growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wa|| Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the release of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excellent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wil| Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wil| add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
