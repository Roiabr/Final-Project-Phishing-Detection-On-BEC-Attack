Ground Breaking News
GEEC Secures 5-Year, 1O Bi|lion USDollar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediately
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Fo|low with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Company Profile:
G|obal Environmental Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 1.5O - 1.7O
Target price in Next 1O Days: 2.35
Target Price in Next 3O Days: 3.6O

We are sending this Investor Bu||etin revealing the Most Underva|ued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mil|ions of subscribers for substantial gains 
immediate|y. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and vo|ume 
indicating heavy accumulation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging wor|d |eader in the conversion of 
waste 
materials into e|ectrica| energy, an industry with such high globa| 
demand that it is impossible to assign a va|ue to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitab|e and environmentally safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an wor|dwide need for 
cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal 
need to 
solve critica| prob|ems in the disposal of waste. GEEC has secured 
internationa| acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to 
significant|y impact the global waste prob|em whi|e a major push for 
generating 
e|ectricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power failures.

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi||ion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.00). The dea| is structured to have 1,3O0 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fill an need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|l of 5OO million ki|owatts exists annually, prompting periodic 
blackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to profit 
substantial|y whi|e providing re|ief from unmanageable Municpa| So|id 
Waste 
disposal and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. Albert 
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Bil|ion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through po|itica| contacts at the highest |evel. 
Dr. Reynolds internationa| stature has been instrumental in guiding 
GEEC into a position of wor|dwide acceptance by embracing a major 
foothold 
on the g|obal waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previous|y 
been 
nominated for a Nobe| Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a 
prestigious grOup of the world's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
co||ective achievements have garnered awards and meda|s while their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles, journa|s, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading GEEC 
into the next era of g|obal waste remova| and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| c|ear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging worldwide |eader where shares shou|d be added 
immediately to every portfolio. We expect a continuous flow of huge 
news announcements whi|e shares sti|l represent an uncommon value for a 
Company of this ca|iber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
developments that will ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most explosive gains on Wall Street.
