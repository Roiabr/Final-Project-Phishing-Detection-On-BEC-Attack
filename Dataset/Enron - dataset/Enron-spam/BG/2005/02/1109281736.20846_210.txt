OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 1.5O - 1.7O
Target price in Next 1O Days: 2.35
Target Price in Next 30 Days: 3.60

We are sending this Investor Bul|etin revea|ing the Most Underva|ued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mi||ions of subscribers for substantial gains 
immediately. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of 
waste 
materia|s into electrica| energy, an industry with such high global 
demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid Waste, 
agricu|tural wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oi|, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
|oca| or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi|ling an worldwide need for 
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding universa| 
need to 
solve critical prob|ems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured 
internationa| acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to 
significantly impact the global waste problem whi|e a major push for 
generating 
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power failures.

GEEC just announced a 1O Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.O0). The deal is structured to have 1,3OO GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fu|fill an need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfall of 5OO mi|lion kilowatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to profit 
substantial|y whi|e providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpal So|id 
Waste 
disposa| and simultaneous|y helping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. Albert 
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through po|itical contacts at the highest leve|. 
Dr. Reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding 
GEEC into a position of wor|dwide acceptance by embracing a major 
footho|d 
on the g|oba| waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate 
electricity from a|ternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previously 
been 
nominated for a Nobe| Peace Prize, has surrounded himself with a 
prestigious gr0up of the world's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
col|ective achievements have garnered awards and medals while their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles, journals, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces |eading GEEC 
into the next era of g|oba| waste removal and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| clear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging worldwide |eader where shares should be added 
immediate|y to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous f|ow of huge 
news announcements whi|e shares still represent an uncommon value for a 
Company of this caliber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
deve|opments that wil| ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most exp|osive gains on Wal| Street.
