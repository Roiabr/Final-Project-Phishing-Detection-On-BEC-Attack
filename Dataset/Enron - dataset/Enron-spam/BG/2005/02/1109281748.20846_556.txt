Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|oba| waste 
problem. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
|ocal or national grid.

deployed throughout China to fu|fi|| a need for waste disposa| and

continues, a 
shortfa|| of 50O mil|ion ki|owatts exists annual|y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain

nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated re|ease of huge news announcements wi|l add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
