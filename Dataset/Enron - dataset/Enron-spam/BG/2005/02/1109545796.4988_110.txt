wan Road=0AHong Kong.=0ASir,=0ALet me start by introducing myself. I am Mr =
Feng Lee. director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branc=
h.I have  a mutual beneficial business suggestion for you.=0ABefore the U.S=
 and Iraqi war, our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces a=
nd also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months=
, with a value of  Fifty Five million,Five Hundred Thousand United State Do=
llars(US$55.5M) only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice was sent to =
him, even during the war two years ago(2003).Again after the war another =
=0Anotification was sent and still no response came from him. We later foun=
d out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb =
blast that hit their home.=0AAfter further investigation it was also discov=
ered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official =
papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided i=
n me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his de=
posit in my bank.So,Fifty Five million,Five Hundred Thousand United State D=
ollars(US$55.5M) is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forwar=
d to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to  the laws of my cou=
ntry at the expiration four years six months the funds will revert to the o=
wnership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.=
=0AAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a=
 foreigner to front for me and  stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Base=
m so that you will be able to receive his funds.=0APlease,if you are capabl=
e of standing as the next of Kin to Major Fadi Basem,you should indicate so=
 that I will give you more information.Absolute confidentiality is required=
 from you.Besides,I will use my connection to get some documents to back up=
 the fund so that the fund can not be question by any authourity.=0AI will =
give you further details of the transaction when I recieve a positive respo=
nse from you and also the ration which the money will be shared between bot=
h of us.=0A=0ATreat as very urgent.=0A=0AYours Faithfully,=0A=0AMr. Feng Le=
