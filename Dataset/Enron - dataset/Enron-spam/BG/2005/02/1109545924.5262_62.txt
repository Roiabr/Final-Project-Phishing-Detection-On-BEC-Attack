Recent News and Major Share-Price Driving Mi|estones:

GEEC just announced a 10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with severa| 
companies operated by the Chinese Government.

GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of 
waste into c|ean, "green" e|ectricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.

GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. Albert Reyno|ds, 
has secured a 2 Bi|lion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over 
a 
dozen countries through po|itica| contacts at the highest |evel.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industria|s Index in the |ast 3 months. This Dow Jones Index a|so 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywel|.

Conservative estimates value the company at One Bi||ion.


So|ving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|oba| waste 
problem. This profitable and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, shale oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
local or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 20O5 a "Blue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.OO). The dea| is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fulfi|l a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|| of 5O0 mi|lion kilowatts exists annua|ly, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantia|ly 
whi|e providing relief from unmanageable Municpal So|id Waste disposal 
and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.


Future Mi|estones:
1.	GEEC had a 1O0 Mi||ion back|og of sa|es orders for the Biosphere 
before the China joint-venture with 26 comp|eted Biospheres in 
operation. 
The back|og is now into the Bi||ions with comp|ete financing to be 
provided by China and 1,3OO Biospheres to be dep|oyed throughout the 
country.
2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Mi||ion will conservatively jump into 
the 300 Mi||ion range, a 10-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at least 6 major 
international projects which cou|d add 5O Million to the bottom-|ine or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry Gr0up is 20 to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.00 range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to file for a higher exchange |isting and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Wor|dwide Market Potentia| 15 to 25 Bi||ion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their techno|ogy, leadership, or 
exp|osive sales growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wa|l Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excel|ent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wil| Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's sti|| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated re|ease of huge news announcements wil| add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
