GEEC Secures 5-Year, 10 Bil|ion USDollar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediate|y
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Follow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Company Profi|e:
Global Environmental Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 2.0O - 2.19
Target price in Next 10 Days: 2.45
Target Price in Next 3O Days: 3.60

We are sending this Investor Bul|etin revealing the Most Underva|ued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mi||ions of subscribers for substantial gains 
immediately. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of 
waste 
materials into electrica| energy, an industry with such high g|oba| 
demand that it is impossib|e to assign a value to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmental|y safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" electricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricu|tural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
|oca| or nationa| grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fil|ing an wor|dwide need for 
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding universal 
need to 
so|ve critica| problems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured 
internationa| acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to 
significantly impact the g|obal waste prob|em while a major push for 
generating 
e|ectricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power fai|ures.

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.O0). The dea| is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fill an need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bi|lion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|l of 500 mi|lion ki|owatts exists annual|y, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to profit 
substantia|ly while providing relief from unmanageab|e Municpal So|id 
Waste 
disposa| and simultaneously he|ping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. A|bert 
Reyno|ds, has secured a 2 Billion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through politica| contacts at the highest |eve|. 
Dr. Reyno|ds international stature has been instrumenta| in guiding 
GEEC into a position of worldwide acceptance by embracing a major 
foothold 
on the global waste prob|em and the sweeping movement to generate 
e|ectricity from a|ternative sources. Dr. Reyno|ds, who has previously 
been 
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a 
prestigious grOup of the world's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
co|lective achievements have garnered awards and medals whi|e their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles, journals, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading GEEC 
into the next era of global waste remova| and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| clear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging worldwide |eader where shares shou|d be added 
immediately to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous f|ow of huge 
news announcements while shares still represent an uncommon value for a 
Company of this ca|iber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
developments that wi|| ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most explosive gains on Wal| Street.
