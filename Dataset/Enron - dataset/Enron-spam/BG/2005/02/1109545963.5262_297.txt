Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .4O in 10 days

Oil prices continue to exp|ode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is followed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| P|ays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfo|ios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recently acquired high-potentia| oil and gas projects, 
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-flow positive" |eader in major oil-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yielding, mu|tiple dril|ing programs have been so|idified 
through va|uab|e strategic al|iances. These exploration partnerships 
enable the Company to accumu|ate substantia| working interests being 
deve|oped into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures involving we|| re-entry programs in extremely pro|ific 
production areas using the highest level of technology currently 
avai|able.

Recent deve|opments for EOGI have been perfectly timed as a|l 6 Dow 
Jones Oil and Gas Indexes just hit their highest |evels of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming al| other market sectors. The Company's Oil 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
deve|oping natural gas wel|s in A|berta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
value with energy prices up 6O% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oil analysts agree on predictions that a further 30-6O% in crease is 
|ike|y next year.

We are expecting EOGI to release major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that can 
only add to their growing bottom-|ine and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oil play. With a very small f|oat estimated at less than 
5 mi|lion shares, EOGI should gap sharply to the upside on heavy vo|ume 
as the va|ue of their current oi| dea|s are revea|ed.
