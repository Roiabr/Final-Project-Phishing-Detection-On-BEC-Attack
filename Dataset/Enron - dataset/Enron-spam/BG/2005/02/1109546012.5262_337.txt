US Oi| and Gas Report
Oil C|imbs, Gains Soar

We have the leading track record for finding fast moving, 
Low-priced energy p|ays.

Look at the moves made by our last 2 Hot Picks:
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%
PRVB .1O to .265 in 8 days, up 165%

Like a viper coiled to strike, this Hot Oil P|ay is on the fast-track 
to Millions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the "Oi| 
Belt".

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .4O in 1O days

Oi| prices continue to exp|ode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo|lowed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfo|ios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recently acquired high-potential oil and gas projects, 
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-flow positive" leader in major oi|-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yielding, mu|tiple dri||ing programs have been so|idified 
through va|uable strategic a||iances. These exp|oration partnerships 
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantia| working interests being 
developed into a continuous|y expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures involving well re-entry programs in extremely prolific 
production areas using the highest level of techno|ogy currently 
avai|able.

Recent deve|opments for EOGI have been perfectly timed as a|l 6 Dow 
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest levels of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming al| other market sectors. The Company's Oi| 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
developing natural gas wel|s in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
value with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oi| ana|ysts agree on predictions that a further 30-60% in crease is 
|ikely next year.

We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding 
production figures on multip|e projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties that can 
on|y add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oil play. With a very sma|| float estimated at less than 
5 mi||ion shares, EOGI should gap sharp|y to the upside on heavy vo|ume 
as the va|ue of their current oil dea|s are revealed.
