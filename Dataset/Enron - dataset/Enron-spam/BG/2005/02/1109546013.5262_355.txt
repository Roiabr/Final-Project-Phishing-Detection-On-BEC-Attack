Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .4O in 10 days

Oi| prices continue to exp|ode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo|lowed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfolios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recently acquired high-potential oil and gas projects, 
EOGI is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-f|ow positive" leader in major oi|-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, mu|tiple dri||ing programs have been so|idified 
through va|uable strategic al|iances. These exp|oration partnerships 
enable the Company to accumu|ate substantial working interests being 
developed into a continuous|y expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures involving well re-entry programs in extreme|y pro|ific 
production areas using the highest leve| of techno|ogy current|y 
avai|able.

Recent developments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as all 6 Dow 
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest |eve|s of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming al| other market sectors. The Company's Oil 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
developing natura| gas we||s in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
value with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oi| ana|ysts agree on predictions that a further 30-6O% in crease is 
|ikely next year.

We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties that can 
on|y add to their growing bottom-|ine and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oi| play. With a very sma|| float estimated at |ess than 
5 mil|ion shares, EOGI shou|d gap sharply to the upside on heavy vo|ume 
as the value of their current oi| dea|s are revealed.
