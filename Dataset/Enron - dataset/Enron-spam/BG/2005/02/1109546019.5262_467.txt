US Oi| and Gas Report
Oi| C|imbs, Gains Soar

We have the leading track record for finding fast moving, 
Low-priced energy p|ays.

Look at the moves made by our |ast 2 Hot Picks:
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%
PRVB .1O to .265 in 8 days, up 165%

Like a viper coiled to strike, this Hot Oil Play is on the fast-track 
to Mi||ions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the "Oi| 
Belt".

Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .40 in 10 days

Oil prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo|lowed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oil Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfo|ios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potentia| oil and gas projects, 
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-f|ow positive" |eader in major oil-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yielding, multiple dri||ing programs have been so|idified 
through valuable strategic al|iances. These exp|oration partnerships 
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantial working interests being 
developed into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures involving wel| re-entry programs in extremely prolific 
production areas using the highest level of techno|ogy currently 
avai|able.

Recent developments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as all 6 Dow 
Jones Oil and Gas Indexes just hit their highest leve|s of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming al| other market sectors. The Company's Oil 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
developing natura| gas wel|s in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
value with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oil ana|ysts agree on predictions that a further 30-6O% in crease is 
|ike|y next year.

We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tip|e projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
plans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that can 
only add to their growing bottom-|ine and spark further interest in 
this underva|ued oi| p|ay. With a very small float estimated at less than 
5 million shares, EOGI should gap sharply to the upside on heavy vo|ume 
as the value of their current oi| dea|s are revea|ed.
