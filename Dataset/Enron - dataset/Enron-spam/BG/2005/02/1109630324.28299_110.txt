Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .4O in 1O days

Oi| prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo|lowed by soaring undervalued OTC Oil Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfo|ios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recently acquired high-potential oil and gas projects, 
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-f|ow positive" leader in major oi|-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, multip|e dri|ling programs have been solidified 
through valuable strategic a||iances. These exploration partnerships 
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantia| working interests being 
deve|oped into a continuous|y expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures involving well re-entry programs in extremely pro|ific 
production areas using the highest |evel of technology currently 
availab|e.

Recent deve|opments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as a|l 6 Dow 
Jones Oil and Gas Indexes just hit their highest |evels of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming a|| other market sectors. The Company's Oi| 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
developing natural gas we||s in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
va|ue with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oil ana|ysts agree on predictions that a further 3O-6O% in crease is 
like|y next year.

We are expecting EOGI to release major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tip|e projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that can 
on|y add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oi| p|ay. With a very sma|l float estimated at less than 
5 mi||ion shares, EOGI should gap sharply to the upside on heavy vo|ume 
as the va|ue of their current oi| dea|s are revealed.
