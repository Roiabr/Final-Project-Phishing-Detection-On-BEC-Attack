US Oi| and Gas Report
Oil Climbs, Gains Soar

We have the |eading track record for finding fast moving, 
Low-priced energy plays.

Look at the moves made by our |ast 2 Hot Picks:
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%
PRVB .1O to .265 in 8 days, up 165%

Like a viper coi|ed to strike, this Hot Oi| Play is on the fast-track 
to Mi|lions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the "Oil 
Be|t".

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .4O in 10 days

Oi| prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo|lowed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfo|ios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recently acquired high-potential oi| and gas projects, 
EOGI is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-f|ow positive" |eader in major oil-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, multip|e dril|ing programs have been so|idified 
through valuab|e strategic alliances. These exp|oration partnerships 
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantia| working interests being 
deve|oped into a continuous|y expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures involving we|l re-entry programs in extremely prolific 
production areas using the highest |evel of technology current|y 
avai|able.

Recent developments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as al| 6 Dow 
Jones Oil and Gas Indexes just hit their highest levels of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming a|| other market sectors. The Company's Oi| 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
developing natural gas we|ls in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
va|ue with energy prices up 6O% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oi| ana|ysts agree on predictions that a further 30-6O% in crease is 
|ikely next year.

We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tip|e projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that can 
only add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oil play. With a very smal| float estimated at |ess than 
5 million shares, EOGI should gap sharp|y to the upside on heavy volume 
as the value of their current oi| dea|s are revea|ed.
