(&#147;Sunwin&#148;) has built an integrated global firm with the sourcing and production capabilities to meet the needs of consumers throughout the world. Sunwin is a pioneer in the research and development and production of essential traditional Chinese medicine, 100 percent organic herbal medicine, nutraceutical products, natural sweetener (Stevioside), and animal medicine prepared from 100% organic herbal ingredients. The Company also makes such value-added products as specialty veterinary food ingredients and specialty feed ingredients. The Sunwin family works closely with consumer to provide a quality, value, and a hybrid mix of agricultural products and services that meet growing demand. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2002, Sunwin was recognized as one of the first 2,000 state-level companies that China authorized as the most important innovative high-tech pioneer businesses by the China central government. In 2002, Sunwin was awarded as one of 2002 state-level biological product manufacturers in China . In 2003, Sunwin ranked as one of the top 50 companies of China Animal Related Health Care Product Pharmaceutical Industry in terms of sales by the Ministry of Agriculture of China . In 2003, Sunwin received the award of Shandong Top Ten Innovative, High-Tech Businesses by the Province Government of Shandong. </font></p>

                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Warren Buffett Said U.S. Stocks are too expensive and he poured a chunk of his money into China . That's especially important now, since Warren Buffett made such big news with his huge China investment. Everyone knows what happens when Mr. Buffett gets into a market, it usually explodes. Mr. Buffett's strong move also means that every charlatan stock advisor in the U.S. will now be trying to sell you some sort of hot Chinese investment. But they don't have what we have. They don't have a network of analysts already on the ground in China doing the hard work for you. The fortunes made on the American stock markets in the late 1990s will look paltry when compared to the profit explosion that's set to blast out of China in the coming years. As you're about to see, there's not a single reason &#150; not one &#150; for you to miss what should be the greatest wealth creation opportunity of your lifetime. </font></p></td>
              <td width="47%"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">- </font></strong><font size="2"><em><u>You know what happens when Warren Buffett gets onto a good thing, everybody gets rich</u> </em>. Warren Buffett has gotten into China , here's what the respected Bloomberg News said about that. These excerpts come from a May 22, 2003 Bloomberg News wire story: &#147;Warren Buffett's search for cheap stocks has brought his to a surprising place: China . A month after telling Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that shares of U.S. companies were too expensive, Buffett's company upped its stake in PetroChina. (It now owns 13.35% of the company.).</font></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>- </strong>It's clear that China is the place for you to be now and in the coming years. The profits will be stunning, but only if you're aligned with an expert team that puts you into the best Chinese companies first. One reason for that sweet number is because Sunwin's product is of such high quality. In fact, its customers during the past year as divided equally between major suppliers in Japan and China . And SUWN has a nice mix of both local and export customers. Last year, they had sales to the local Chinese domestic, exports to Japan 20% and exports to other foreign countries. When SUWN's natural sweetener penetrates the US markets, it will take some market share of synthetic sweetener. Even natural sweetener takes a tiny fraction of market share of synthetic sweetener in the US ; it could means tens of millions of dollars to SUWN. SUWN will add a new manufacturing line for its natural sweetener in 2004/2005 that should make 300 tons of highly purified natural sweetener. It will add $9 million to $12 million in sales and $2 to $3 million in net income. This is why betting on SUWN is a sure thing to win huge! They're testimony to a management team that has excellent control over SUWN's cost of goods sold and operating expenses. This is a well-run company that we should assume, will continue this path and grow by acquiring more top-quality beet sugar producers as well. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- We believe the SUWN story will get a lot of attention in the investment community in the coming months. The average company on this list in this industry has a market cap valued at 7.17 X revenues. On this ground alone, we should expect SUWN market cap to be $89 million, or <strong>$2.63 per share </strong>! The average of PE ratio in the industry is 27.1. On this ground alone, it will give SUWN stock valued at <strong>$1 per share </strong>. The average ratio of price/earning/growth in the industry on the list is 1.1. On this ground alone, we should expect SUWN to be <strong>$3 per share </strong>. An average valuation will value SUWN at <strong>$2 per share. </strong>We believe that it is just a matter of time before <strong>SUWN, an undervalued stock with tremendous upside potential, </strong> will be recognized by Wall Street, and then the stock price will soar to a much higher level when it is listed on the AMEX!</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">Fort Lauderdale, FL, March 2, 2005 </font></strong> <font size="2">&#150; (Business Wire) - Sunwin International Neutraceuticals, Inc. (OTCBB: SUWN ), a leading manufacturer of Chinese herbs, veterinary medicines and low calorie natural sweetener ( Stevia ) in China, announced today it has signed the letter of intent to acquire 55% controlling interest of Jining Stevia Manufacturing Company via a stock exchange on the basis of net tangible assets of Jining Stevia Manufacturing Company. Completion of the transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a mutually satisfactory stock exchange agreement, receipt of audited financial statements of the company to be acquired, receipt of necessary corporate approval by both parties, satisfactory completion of due diligence and other customary conditions of closing.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the combined production of the two companies, Sunwin will produce approximately 800 tons of Stevia per year or approximately 50% of the worldwide production, based on 2004 numbers. Stevia is becoming a mainstay of the extreme no-carb sweetener market worldwide . The current production of approximately 1,600 tons per year worldwide will not meet the dramatically increasing demand worldwide, especially in the US.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tongtong Lin, newly appointed Sunwin's CEO, commented, &#147; Our goal is to increase our leading position in the production of Stevia. The low calorie sweetener market is a multi-billion dollar global market of both synthetic and natural sweeteners. We believe the natural, low calorie sweetener Stevia will eventually replace the demand for synthetic sweeteners worldwide in the near future. Natural sweeteners provide what most users feel is a far superior taste than synthetic sweeteners without having the side effects to human organs and systems as synthetic sweetener have our current combined production of natural sweetener will accounts for approximately 50% of worldwide production. With an increasingly price of Stevia at $35,000 per ton, the acquisition will allow us to generate over $28 million in sales and with an anticipated $3 million in net income from the production of Stevioside alone.&#148;</font></p>
