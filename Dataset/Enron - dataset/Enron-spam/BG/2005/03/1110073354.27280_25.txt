available next of kin to claim.

To this regards, I have been directed by the board of Trustees of the
bank to notify the diseased next of kin, which I have done and found

development, myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now see=

account.

risk free transaction. You will be allowed to retain 30% of the total 
amountafter the transaction. If this proposal is okay by you, and you wis=
