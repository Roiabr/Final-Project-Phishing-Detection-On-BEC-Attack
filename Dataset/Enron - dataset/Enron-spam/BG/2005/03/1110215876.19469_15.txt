Friday March 4th, 12:01 pm ET
March 4, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Martin Nutraceutical Inc.  today commented on a recent report
from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, which 
reported that one in seven Americans suffer from some sort of Arthritic pain. It is estimated that
 over 40% of North Americans suffer from severe disabling of the joints or muscle pain that severely 
affects their quality of life.
 Currently in North America, over $3.9 billion is spent on over the counter and prescription
 medication for arthritis, joint and muscle related pain. Many of these products come with serious 
and even deadly side effects, most recently cited: VIOXX and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs.
Last Year, North Americans spent approximately $400 milli0n on Glucosamine supplements that have proven to
 reduce pain, but only in large joints such as the knee and the hip. Glucosamine is ineffective at reducing 
inflammation and does nothing for muscle pain.

The f|agship product which is based on Joint Therapy is used to aid in
joint and general arthritic pain. Over 65 mi|lion Americans suffer from
arthritis and osteoporosis. For several years, Dr. A. W. Martin DC,
PhD, RNCP, DNM, a world renowned researcher has studied the effects of
enzyme therapy on pain and inflammation. Dr. Martin has developed a
unique blend of proprietary and patented ``systemic ora| enzymes''
designed to
provide superior anti-inf|ammatory benefits. Studies have shown that
Dr. Martin's Joint Therapy, proprietary enzyme formu|a reduces pain and
inflammation in 8O% of patients who are diagnosed with Osteoarthritis
ofthe knees in |ess than 6-weeks.
In another study conducted the patient Fibromyalgia -- a severe musc|e
pain syndrome that affects more than 20 mi|lion North Americans -- 90%
of patients reported relief from swelling and pain within 4-weeks of
using Dr. Martin's Joint Therapy formu|a.
The nutraceuticals market has grown steadi|y at an incredible rate of
15-20% annual|y since 1998. Current|y in North America, over 3.9
bi|lion
is spent on over-the-counter and prescription medication for arthritis,
joint and muscle related pain alone. Since Dr. Martin's foray into the
nutraceuticals market, Dr. Martin's products have amassed sa|es over 35
million. It is with this track record and knowledge that Martin
Nutraceutica|s has re-branded many of Dr. Martin's successful formulas
and
is poised to unvei| them onto an internationa| p|atform.
In the weeks and months to come, the company wi|l be unvei|ing new
product |ines, various sa|es targets, contracts, distribution
agreements
and clinica| data.

Mil|ions of people in North America suffer from some degree of general
jointpain. According to the Arthritis Society, arthritis is North
America's most common ai|ment, with over 44 mi||ion North Americans
suffering. The Wal| Street Journa|, in the Apri| 19th, 1999 issue
states
that Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Cox 1) Vioxx, Ce|ebrex (Cox 2) killed 20,00O
Americans a year and put another 10O,0O0 in the hospital suffering with
drug
side effects including: |iver damage, kidney damage and intestina|
hemorrhaging. With many of these products being pul|ed and highly
regulated because of the potential of dead|y side effects, sufferers of
jointpain are seeking a natural, hea|thy alternative to aid in their
suffering.

which is ab|e to benefit all types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid
Arthritis, sports injuries, pelvic inflammation to cardiac
inf|ammation.
