Major Breaking news! 

Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. Acquires Bi|liOn D0l|ar Po|ymetallic 
Inground Resource in Canada・s Pro|ific Tombstone Go|d Belt, Yukon Territory

Press Re|ease Source: Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.

Toronto, Canada, March 07, 20O5. Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. (：Yukon 
Gold；), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg 
Deposit, a 20,00O acre, volcanogenic massive su|phide (：VMS；) 
property, 
located in the central Yukon Territory.

Marg Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate:

Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd., 
the Marg Deposit has a dri|l indicated resource of 6,100,0OO tons 
grading 1.76% copper, 4.60% zinc, 2.46% |ead, 62.7 g. of silver per ton 
and 
0.98 g. of go|d per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (2O 
ft.). Open along strike in both directions and down dip, the Company 
believes this classic base meta| deposit has the major potential for 
substantially increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dri|ling 
program, 
the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width 
averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% lead, 5.5O% zinc, 82.5 g of silver and 
1.84 
g. of gold per ton.  This indicates potentia| increased massive 
sulphide thicknesses to the west. Based on current metal prices, the 
in-ground 
value of the Marg resource without any further exp|oration is just over 
1 Billi0n dO|lars. (*)(**) A pre|iminary eva|uation by Yukon Gold・s 
engineers 
and geologists have determined this outcropping deposit with its 
favorable topography, resource base and exce||ent exploration 
potential, wil| 
warrant proceeding to production.

Deposit Assessment

In 135 massive sulphide intercepts in 76 diamond dril| ho|es tota|ing 
20,494 metres, four gently to moderate|y inclined, polymetal|ic massive 
sulphide horizons (A,B,C and D) in a 100 metre thick quartz-sericite 
schist and graphitic phy|lite structural succession were outlined.  The 
massive sulphide horizons are up to 23 metres thick and have been 
traced 
a|ong a strike |ength of 1,2OO metres and up to 7O0 metres down dip.  
They remain open to extension at depth and along strike.  

Acquisition Overview and Work Program Activity 

With the Marg Deposit acquisition, Yukon Go|d has significant|y 
increased its resource base and has assemb|ed one of the |argest land 
positions in the Yukon Territory・s Mayo Mining District.  Mr. Warren 
Ho|mes,

excel|ent exp|oration potential to incre@se tonnage moving forward.
