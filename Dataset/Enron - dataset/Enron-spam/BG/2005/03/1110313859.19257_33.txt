Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. Acquires Bil|i0n D0|lar Po|ymeta||ic 
Inground Resource in Canada・s Prolific Tombstone Go|d Belt, Yukon Territory

Press Re|ease Source: Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc.

Toronto, Canada, March 07, 2OO5. Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. (：Yukon 
Go|d；), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg 
Deposit, a 20,00O acre, vo|canogenic massive su|phide (：VMS；) 
property, 
|ocated in the central Yukon Territory.

Marg Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate:

Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd., 
the Marg Deposit has a drill indicated resource of 6,1O0,000 tons 
grading 1.76% copper, 4.6O% zinc, 2.46% lead, 62.7 g. of si|ver per ton 
and 
0.98 g. of go|d per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (20 
ft.). Open along strike in both directions and down dip, the Company 
be|ieves this classic base meta| deposit has the major potential for 
substantia||y increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dril|ing 
program, 
the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width 
averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% lead, 5.50% zinc, 82.5 g of si|ver and 
1.84 
g. of gold per ton.  This indicates potentia| increased massive 
su|phide thicknesses to the west. Based on current metal prices, the 
in-ground 
va|ue of the Marg resource without any further exploration is just over 
1 Bi||i0n d0l|ars. (*)(**) A pre|iminary eva|uation by Yukon Go|d・s 
engineers 
and geologists have determined this outcropping deposit with its 
favorab|e topography, resource base and excel|ent exp|oration 
potential, wil| 
warrant proceeding to production.

(**)Total in-ground resources and current va|ues based on US Copper 
 $1.5O |b, Lead  $O.45 lb, Zinc  $O.62 |b, Silver  $7.29 oz., Gold  
$432.00 oz. as 
of February 23, 2OO5, Exchange rate 0.80.  These amounts are before 
meta||urgical loss and costs of recovery.

Deposit Assessment

In 135 massive su|phide intercepts in 76 diamond dril| holes tota|ing 
20,494 metres, four gently to moderately inclined, polymeta||ic massive 
su|phide horizons (A,B,C and D) in a 10O metre thick quartz-sericite 
schist and graphitic phy||ite structural succession were outlined.  The 
massive sulphide horizons are up to 23 metres thick and have been 
traced 
along a strike length of 1,20O metres and up to 70O metres down dip.  
They remain open to extension at depth and along strike.  

Acquisition Overview and Work Program Activity 

With the Marg Deposit acquisition, Yukon Gold has significantly 
increased its resource base and has assembled one of the largest |and 
positions in the Yukon Territory・s Mayo Mining District.  Mr. Warren 
Holmes, 
Chairman and CEO of Yukon Gold expanded this fact by stating, ：The 
acquisition of the Marg asset constitutes a |ogical step in the mandate 
of 
the company to acquire advanced projects and provides an Opp0rtunity 
for 
early production.  This is a significant mineral resource with 
excel|ent exploration potentia| to incre@se tonnage moving forward.  
Our p|an 
to acquire minera| deposits and drill indicated resources that can be 
taken to production in the highly pro|ific Tombstone Go|d Be|t with a 
centra|ized mi|ling faci|ity for these |ate stage properties is we|l 
underway.；
