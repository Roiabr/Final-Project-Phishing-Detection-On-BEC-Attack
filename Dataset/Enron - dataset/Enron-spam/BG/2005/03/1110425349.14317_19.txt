The Oil and Gas Advisory

Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market, 
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining 
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.

Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Be|t" 
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating 
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .12
Sel| Target - .33 = Diamond P|ay

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:
1.	Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.
2.	Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.
3.	With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth multi-mil|ions, EOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the 
va|ue of its assets.
4.	Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.

A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the 
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry 
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are 
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and 
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to undervalued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small company 
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with 
the daily jump in energy prices.

But all that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive 
effect on 
the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oil and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases 
in 
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or dec|ine 
s|ight|y, you wi|l sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or 
so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings wi|| 
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy 
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, 
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and 
gas 
reserves are we|l established and are going into massive production. 
Early 
investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in this 
area wi|l rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets 
upward in next week's bu||etin.
