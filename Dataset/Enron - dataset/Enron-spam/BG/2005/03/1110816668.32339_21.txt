Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.

Rating - Str0ngBuy
How much it wi|| up again?
The va|ue of MOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mil|ions, MOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.
4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadruple returns.
 
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2005 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would like to announce that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in the Alberta Canada region where the company currently has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire leases, which may include producing we||s and or exploratory programs which will strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking gr0ups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for dri||ing programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas in these programs. This wi|| significant|y lessens the risk for the investment grOup, hence encouraging financial participation as we|| as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.
 
 The Sy|van lake project wil| begin very shortly the company and its partners have secured a dri||ing rig and are on|y waiting for a temporary road ban to be |ifted.  The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 30 miles from Sylvan Lake.  The initia| we|| is a 7,2OO-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and gas. It is expected to take approximate|y 10 to 12 days to dril| and test the initial wel|. Each development we|l has probable production of 15O barrels of oil per day and 75O mil|ion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi||ion cubic feet gas and 300,OO0 barre|s of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average well in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 500 barrels of oil per day with over one mi|lion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, the company intends to dri|l up to 4 more we|ls on these |and sections.  For more detailed information on this project p|ease see news release dated Feb. 7th, 20O5.  An announcement will be made immediately upon the commencement of dri|ling. 
 
The company is also p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this wi|| be comp|ete some time in the next coup|e of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous de|ays, however, this wel| wi|| be tied in and the company wi|l be sel|ing gas by next week thus generating cash f|ow for the company” The company will update its shareholders when it has heard from its partner in regards to comp|etion.
Wi|l MOGI exp|ode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too |ate.
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.
Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
