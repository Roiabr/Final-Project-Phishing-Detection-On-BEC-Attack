Dear Sir,

Hope you and your company are getting on well. If there is anything that we can do for you, please feel free to write email to info@fina-mould.com to contact me.

Fina mould is an injection mould and plastic parts manufacturer in Shenzhen, China. We have rich experience in the mould-making and moulding technique. We provide professional suggestion to our customers on the design of their products.ISO9002 certified Fina Mould is looking to establish a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship with your company. 

Mould design and the manufacturing system are under the control of our experienced International team. Your project is personally managed by one of our project engineers.Sometimes we also help our customers to design their products. This helps us to make delivery just-in-time and lead to high quality.  

Fina mould is aware of the price competitive environment in the European and North American markets, a major factor contributing to our rapid growth. Many manufacturers are now outsourcing the mould and plastic parts manufacture to an offshore company and we hope that you consider our company as your offshore source for quality tools and plastic parts.

Last year Fina mould shipped over 260 mould sets to Europe and USA.
