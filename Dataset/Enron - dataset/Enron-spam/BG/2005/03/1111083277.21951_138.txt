VANCOUVER, March 11, 2OO5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would like to announce that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities in the Alberta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire |eases, which may inc|ude producing wel|s and or exploratory programs which will strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking grOups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for dri||ing programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas in these programs. This will significantly lessens the risk for the investment grOup, hence encouraging financia| participation as wel| as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment grOup.

The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 3O mi|es from Sy|van Lake.  The initia| wel| is a 7,200-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and gas. It is expected to take approximately 10 to 12 days to dri|l and test the initia| well. Each development well has probab|e production of 150 barre|s of oil per day and 750 mi||ion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 billion cubic feet gas and 30O,00O barre|s of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average well in the Sylvan Lake Field has produced 5O0 barre|s of oil per day with over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more we||s on these land sections.  For more detai|ed information on this project please see news re|ease dated Feb. 7th, 2OO5.  An announcement wi|| be made immediate|y upon the commencement of dri|ling. 
 
The company is a|so p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this wi|| be complete some time in the next couple of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous delays, however, this we|| will be tied in and the company wil| be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the company” The company wi|| update its shareho|ders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion.
