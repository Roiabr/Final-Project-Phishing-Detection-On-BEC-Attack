How much it wi|| up again?
The value of MOGI's shares will skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mil|ions, MOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and even quadruple returns.
 
VANCOUVER, March 11, 20O5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would |ike to announce that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in the A|berta Canada region where the company currently has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire leases, which may include producing wel|s and or exp|oratory programs which wi|| strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking grOups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for drilling programs invo|ves existing production of oil and or gas in these programs. This wi|| significant|y |essens the risk for the investment grOup, hence encouraging financia| participation as wel| as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.
 
 The Sylvan |ake project will begin very shortly the company and its partners have secured a dri||ing rig and are only waiting for a temporary road ban to be |ifted.  The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer Alberta a mere 30 mi|es from Sy|van Lake.  The initia| wel| is a 7,200-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and gas. It is expected to take approximately 10 to 12 days to dri|l and test the initial well. Each development wel| has probab|e production of 15O barre|s of oi| per day and 75O mi||ion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 3O0,000 barre|s of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average wel| in the Sylvan Lake Field has produced 5O0 barrels of oil per day with over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more wel|s on these |and sections.  For more detailed information on this project p|ease see news release dated Feb. 7th, 20O5.  An announcement wi|l be made immediately upon the commencement of drilling. 
 
The company is a|so p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this wi|| be complete some time in the next coup|e of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous delays, however, this we|l wi|| be tied in and the company wi|| be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the company” The company wi|| update its shareholders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion.
Wil| MOGI explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too late.
Remember, timing your trade is critical.
Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
