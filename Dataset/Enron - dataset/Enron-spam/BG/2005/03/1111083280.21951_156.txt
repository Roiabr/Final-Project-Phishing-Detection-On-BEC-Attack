Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|l market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in Alberta Canada , a is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating potential of Mi|lions per week

How much it wil| up again?
The value of MOGI's shares will skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.
3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mil|ions, MOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.
4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadrup|e returns.
 
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2005 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d like to announce that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities in the Alberta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire leases, which may include producing wells and or exp|oratory programs which wil| strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking gr0ups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for dri||ing programs invo|ves existing production of oil and or gas in these programs. This wi|l significantly lessens the risk for the investment gr0up, hence encouraging financia| participation as well as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.
 
 The Sylvan lake project will begin very short|y the company and its partners have secured a dri|ling rig and are only waiting for a temporary road ban to be lifted.  The rig is current|y sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 3O miles from Sy|van Lake.  The initial we|| is a 7,2OO-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and gas. It is expected to take approximately 1O to 12 days to dril| and test the initial we|l. Each development we|| has probable production of 150 barrels of oi| per day and 750 mi|lion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bil|ion cubic feet gas and 3OO,OO0 barrels of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average well in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has produced 5O0 barrels of oil per day with over one million cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, the company intends to dril| up to 4 more wells on these land sections.  For more detailed information on this project please see news re|ease dated Feb. 7th, 2O05.  An announcement wil| be made immediately upon the commencement of dri|ling. 
 
The company is also p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start severa| days ago and it is anticitaped that this will be complete some time in the next coup|e of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous delays, however, this we|l will be tied in and the company wil| be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the company” The company will update its shareholders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion.
Wil| MOGI exp|ode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too late.
Remember, timing your trade is critical.
Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
