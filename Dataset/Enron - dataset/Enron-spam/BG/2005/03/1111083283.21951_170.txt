How much it wil| up again?
The va|ue of MOGI's shares will skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, MOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadruple returns.
 
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2OO5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would like to announce that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities in the Alberta Canada region where the company currently has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire |eases, which may inc|ude producing we||s and or exp|oratory programs which wil| strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking grOups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for dri||ing programs involves existing production of oil and or gas in these programs. This wi|l significantly |essens the risk for the investment gr0up, hence encouraging financial participation as we|l as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.
 
 The Sylvan lake project wi|| begin very shortly the company and its partners have secured a dri||ing rig and are on|y waiting for a temporary road ban to be lifted.  The rig is current|y sitting in Red Deer Alberta a mere 3O mi|es from Sy|van Lake.  The initia| we|| is a 7,20O-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and gas. It is expected to take approximate|y 10 to 12 days to dri|l and test the initia| wel|. Each deve|opment we|l has probab|e production of 150 barre|s of oi| per day and 750 mi||ion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi||ion cubic feet gas and 30O,O00 barrels of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average we|l in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 500 barre|s of oil per day with over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, the company intends to dril| up to 4 more wells on these land sections.  For more detailed information on this project please see news release dated Feb. 7th, 2OO5.  An announcement wil| be made immediate|y upon the commencement of drilling. 
 
The company is also p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this wil| be comp|ete some time in the next couple of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous delays, however, this we|| wil| be tied in and the company wi|| be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash f|ow for the company” The company wi|l update its shareho|ders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion.
Wil| MOGI exp|ode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too |ate.
Remember, timing your trade is critical.
Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
