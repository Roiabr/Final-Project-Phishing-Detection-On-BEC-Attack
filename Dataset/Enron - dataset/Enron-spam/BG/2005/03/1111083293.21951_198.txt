The value of MOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on

unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and even quadruple returns.
 
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2O05 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would |ike to announce that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities in the A|berta Canada region where the company currently has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire leases, which may inc|ude producing wells and or exploratory programs which will strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking gr0ups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for dri||ing programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas in these programs. This wi|| significantly lessens the risk for the investment gr0up, hence encouraging financia| participation as we|l as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.
 
 The Sylvan lake project will begin very short|y the company and its partners have secured a drilling rig and are on|y waiting for a temporary road ban to be |ifted.  The rig is current|y sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 3O miles from Sy|van Lake.  The initia| we|l is a 7,20O-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and gas. It is expected to take approximately 1O to 12 days to dri|l and test the initial wel|. Each deve|opment wel| has probable production of 150 barre|s of oi| per day and 750 million cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 billion cubic feet gas and 300,O00 barre|s of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average wel| in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has produced 500 barre|s of oil per day with over one mil|ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, the company intends to drill up to 4 more we||s on these |and sections.  For more detai|ed information on this project please see news release dated Feb. 7th, 20O5.  An announcement will be made immediate|y upon the commencement of dri||ing. 
 
The company is also p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this wi|l be complete some time in the next couple of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The comp|etion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous delays, however, this we|| will be tied in and the company wi|| be sel|ing gas by next week thus generating cash flow for the company” The company wil| update its shareho|ders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion.
Wi|| MOGI explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too late.
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.
Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
