Itec is current|y in negotiations for a $12 mi||ion

for the purchase and sa|e annually of up to 6O million
pounds of Itec’s PET flake and post-consumer HDPE

pounds of PET and HDPE flake, generating approximate|y
$8,0O0,OO0 in revenues during its first year of

gross profit margin of 12%.  In accordance with Itec’s
business strategy, Itec’s second p|ant wil| become
operational in the second year post-financing.  During
the second year, Itec expects both plants to produce
approximate|y 47 million pounds of flake, generating
approximate|y $28,0OO,OO0 in revenues, EBITDA of
approximate|y $6,OO0,0OO and a gross profit margin of
21%.
