Hi!

We have a new product that we offer to you, C_I_A_L_I_S soft tabs,

Cialis Soft Tabs is the new impotence treatment drug that everyone
is talking about. Soft Tabs acts up to 36 hours, compare this to
only two or three hours of Viagra action! The active ingredient is
Tadalafil, same as in brand Cialis.

Simply dissolve half a pill under your tongue, 10 min before sex,
for the best erections you've ever had!

Soft Tabs also have less sidebacks (you can drive or mix alcohol
drinks with them).
