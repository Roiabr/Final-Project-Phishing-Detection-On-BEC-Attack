Successful acquisition models invariably tap into neglected niche markets that are ripe for
consolidation with huge profit potential If
well executed, roll-up plays can substantially increase shareholder
value, and gross profit margins.

BOWC is our PLAY OF THE MONTH stoc.k pick.

Here are a few simple reasons why one would own Bio-Warm CO.:

BIO-WARM a Korean/American company has over 8 patents registered and licensed.
BIO-WARM produces special clothing that is highly sought after by NAVY and MILITARY INSTALLATIONS
world-wide
as well as companies like UPS, FED-EX and DHL just to name a few.

BOWC CAN EASILY ROLL OFF A MILITARY PRODUCTIONS UNIT AND ENTER THE HOMELANDDEFENSE SECTOR
WHICH SOARED OVER 300% JUST LAST YEAR.

BOWC OEM PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER BY RETAIL STORES SUCH AS WALMART AND TARGET. A PURCHASE ORDER
FROM ONE OF THESE GIANTS COULD SEND THE STOCK SOARING.

BOWC's business potential is built upon the opportunity created by the
international trade of Korea and that Asian Market.
