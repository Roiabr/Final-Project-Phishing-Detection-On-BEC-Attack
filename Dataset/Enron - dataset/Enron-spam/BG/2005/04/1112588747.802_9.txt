How a spammer got the email alias I have devoted to this
list exclusively? No other entity on earth, or off of it,
has been given this address, and it's not exactly an
obvious dictionary entry, now is it?

Who leaked? Does the list have a hole to plug? Anybody
else start getting SPAM from this source?
