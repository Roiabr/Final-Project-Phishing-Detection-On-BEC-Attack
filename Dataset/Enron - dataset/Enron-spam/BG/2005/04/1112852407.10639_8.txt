                    What could be a more bullish sign for a public company than 
                    its CEO buying back a ton of shares? Very little, and the 
                    fact that the <u>CEO/President of SoftNet has  purchased over 
                    1 million shares of STTC in the open market speaks 
                    volumes about his commitment and belief in the company's 
                    prospects</u>.&nbsp; That in turn generally instills confidence 
                    in employees, business partners, analysts, shareholders and 
                    we expect, our readers.&nbsp; But what’s his motivation? </p>
                    <p>Here’s what we know. In real estate, it's always been 
                    “Location, Location, Location!”&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1990s technology 
                    boom, it was “Platform, Platform, Platform!”&nbsp; After the 
                    Internet stock bubble burst and the market sorted out the 
                    strong from the weak, things settled down and a new term 
                    gained prominence in technology circles: “Search Engine.” As 
                    Yahoo grew and eBay became interactive, tech visionaries 
                    could see that “Engine, Engine, Engine!” was the market's 
                    newest money making mantra.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>In this millennium, the growth of Google and Ask Jeeves 
                    has proven that a good search engine can be a terrific money 
                    maker for its owners.&nbsp; <b>SoftNet Technology</b>, has its 
                    own proprietary commerce search engine that operates the 
                    innovative <b>WholesaleByUs.</b> (SoftNet acquired 
                    WholesaleByUs (&quot;WBU&quot;) on July 9, 2004).&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>As SoftNet changed its name and trading symbol to meet 
                    its new business model in August of this year, management 
                    chose to retain one of the Company's best performing 
                    products, instead of selling it off.&nbsp; <b>STTC</b> created a 
                    Solutions Technology subsidiary that would be solely 
                    dedicated to the Company's <b>SecureTime®</b> biometric 
                    payroll system.&nbsp; That's insight - and industry insiders 
                    liked the way SoftNet handled the transition and retention 
                    of a prime revenue stream.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>So, the company now includes a search engine that 
                    Internet retailers can use to their benefit and a biometric 
                    ID system for securing work areas and producing complete 
                    payroll accuracy… in addition to their present ventures. </p>
                    <p>SoftNet is already operating in the Restaurant Industry 
                    and the Casino Industry with its SecureTime® software (<i>can 
                    hospitals and hotels be far behind?</i>) and the recent 
                    launch of&nbsp; the WholesaleByUs web site utilizing the 
                    Company's proprietary search engine is a clear indicator 
                    that the Company is on track, moving ahead, and generating 
                    sales.&nbsp; The aggressive nature of SoftNet's management and 
                    the products SoftNet has in operation may well warrant 
                    bookmarking their symbol and watching what happens.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Solutions Technology, Inc. (STI) provides biometric 
                    identification solutions that easily integrate into customer 
                    business processes, and optimize several areas of business 
                    management that due to issues of security and inefficiecy, 
                    have historically squeazed companies’ profitablility. These 
                    areas include: identity verification, secure site access, 
                    and time &amp; attendance. Furthermore, the company, through its 
                    experienced management team, has developed a business model 
                    that will allow the company to completely eliminate the 
                    complexity and the cost of ownership for its customers. The 
                    combination of the STI tehnology and revolutionary business 
                    model have it positioned to provide a value proposition for 
                    businesses of any size, that will simply be difficult to 
                    beat. </p>
                    <p>The first part of the Solutions Technology equation, that 
                    seperates the company from others, is that STI offers its 
                    positive identification verification systems as a service. 
                    In other words, STI customers do not need to make an 
                    investment in hardware, software licensing, maintenance 
                    contract, spare parts. The customer will never need to 
                    purchase upgrades, and will never need an IT staff. The 
                    SecureTime System is simple to adopt, making it unique in an 
                    industry that due to the high cost of ownership and the 
                    complexity of biometric systems, has made it impossible for 
                    many companies to implement a solution that meets all of 
                    their needs. </p>
                    <p>STI also has developed proprietary technology, unmatched 
                    in its industry. Solutions Technology, Inc. (STI) offers a 
                    customized biometric system as a service that integrates 
                    fingerprint recognition security seamlessly into virtually 
                    any business. The system will dramatically minimize a 
                    company’s risks, streamline its processes, track its 
                    resources, and trim its labor costs. The STI system 
                    generates the secure data transactions and the reports that 
                    companies must have in order to raise the standards for 
                    security and efficiency of its business processes. </p>
                    <p>SecureTime® biometric solutions utilize cutting edge 
                    technologies that identify, capture, and manage these 
                    resources and other demand information. The system enables 
                    clients to supervise and control their resources precisely 
                    and become more efficient, directly affecting their bottom 
                    line. </p>
                    <p>The system consists of two key components: stand alone 
                    biometric terminals and a back office suite of software 
                    services managed by STI. The terminals operate independently 
                    at your site and are synchronized via internal modem or 
                    Internet access. Each biometric terminal verifies identity 
                    while recording a time-stamped transaction. The configurable 
                    back office suite performs data collection and report 
                    generation in a variety of formats, media types and delivery 
                    methods. Furhtermore, STI’s new SecureTime Online allows a 
                    business to get its own reports at any time from anywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>Typical applications for the flexible SecureTime® system 
                    are: <br>
&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Identity Verification (tracks your resources 
                      precisely, by location) <br>
&nbsp;</li>
                      <li>Secure Site Access (controls your alarms, turnstiles, 
                      and/or doors) <br>
&nbsp;</li>
                      <li>Time &amp; Attendance (calculates labor hours, exports 
                      directly to your payroll service) </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>WholesaleByUs</b></p>
                    <p>WholesaleByUs (WBU) is a web-based, application server 
                    based software system that looks to take advantage of the 
                    boom in internet commerce. In fact, Google's IPO focused 
                    investor attention on the growth of the overall search 
                    engine marketplace, while Shopping.com's IPO helped focus 
                    investor attention on comparison shopping search. WBU looks 
                    to take advantage of this burgeoning industry through its 
                    proprietary technology that optimizes every aspect of the 
                    internet marketplace. The WBU system gives customers the 
                    ability to provide suppliers, manufacturers, retail stores 
                    and the like, exponentially expanded visibility and 
                    awareness for their products. </p>
                    <p>Distribution and sale of manufacturer, supplier and 
                    retail outlet products utilizing the WBU technology for 
                    distribution and sale dramatically increases awareness and 
                    visibility for these products through different portals on 
                    the Internet. WBU's technology allows the companies that 
                    supply the products for sale through the WBU system to 
                    benefit from increased product offerings at no additional 
                    cost. The process simply cuts through the shopping search 
                    clutter to bring, the lowest retail price. </p>

                    <p>Product descriptions and prices are mass uploaded by

                    Product descriptions and prices are also uploaded to 
                    WholesaleByUs's web site. Upon order receipt, products are 
                    ordered from a manufacturer's or distributor's inventory 
                    usually within a day. Products are generally shipped to the 
                    buyer with three days of order receipt. If an item is out of 
                    stock, the buyer's money is refunded immediately by 
                    WholesaleByUs. </p>
                    <p>In the short existence of one year, WBU has been able to 
                    reach the Platinum seller status on eBay. WBU has been able 
                    to achieve and maintain a 99.5% satisfaction feedback rate 
                    or higher on eBay. The shopping cart created by WBU has 
                    integrated a back end system to process orders, inventory, 
                    Purchase ordering system, sales tracking and an email 
                    system. </p>
                    <p>Just over a month ago, STTC's new wholly owned 
                    subsidiary, Wholesalebyus.com was offering only 150 products 
                    for sale on eBay.com. In just one short month, WBU has 
                    expanded its ability to provide increased exposure for other 
                    companies' products on the Internet to Amazon.com and 
                    eBay.com. Now, the product offering has increased over 6600% 
                    to more than 10,000 products. The genius displayed by the 
                    WBU management is not just in increasing the product

        One Quarter Revenue </i></b><br>
        <br>
        Bernardsville, NJ, March 30, 2005 – SoftNet Technology (OTCBB Symbol: 
        STTC) (German WKN#: A0B7RZ) is pleased to announce today that the 
        Company has and will generate more revenue than ever recorded in a 
        30-day period for the month of March. Additionally, the Company will 
        also record more revenue, in the first quarter than ever recorded in any 
        one Quarter before. <br>
        <br>
        Two of SoftNet Technology’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Indigo Technology 
        and WholesaleByUs, have ramped up their operations in the past 90 days 
        to accelerate revenues at a quickened pace. Each of these two 
        subsidiaries will generate their best performance, for one quarter (this 
        first quarter), in their respective histories. More impressive is that 
        Indigo and WBU each will have generated more than 50% of their total 
        revenues for the quarter in just the month of March. SoftNet Technology 
        as a company is expected to generate approximately $200,000 in sales for 
        just the month of March – the best one month in the history of STTC.<br>
        <br>
        STTC’s wholly owned subsidiary, (WBU) www.wbushopping.com, individually 
        will generate record revenues for the month of March. Total Internet 
        sales will far exceed $150,000 for the month. More astonishing is the 
        fact that more than two thirds of the revenues generated in March were 
        generated in the second half of the month. This is made possible from 
        all of the technology and procedure changes that were made in December 
        2004 and January 2005. However, total recorded revenue, for the quarter, 
        will be calculated using only sales of products that have been shipped 
        to the customer. All sales not recorded in the first quarter will carry 
        over to the second quarter.<br>
        <br>
        Other Company news - STTC subsidiary Solutions Technology has hired 
        sales people in an initial effort to begin a large-scale rollout of the 
        SecureTime System. Final programming adjustments are being made as well 
        for SoftNet International GmbH in preparation of turning the WBU System 
        live in foreign countries with products for sale from those foreign 
        jurisdictions. The Media Blitz with TVA productions has begun and will 
        ramp up and be in full swing over the next 30 days.<br>
        <br>
        “It took a few months to get things going strong again after the 
        shutdown in early December. But, sales are now back up and even above 
        the levels that we experienced in November of 2004,” said Mr. James M. 
        Farinella, CEO/President of SoftNet Technology. “We have added new 
        programmers and management positions that will ensure continued 
        accelerated and stable growth for the overall Company.”</font><font id="role_document4" face="Arial" color="#008000" size="4"><br>

                    information contained herein, the statements on this website

                    pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
                    Securities Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
                    involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may
                    cause a company's actual results in the future periods to
                    differ materially from forecasted results. These risks and
                    uncertainties include, among other things, product price
                    volatility, product demand, market competition and risk
                    inherent in the companies operations. You can identify these
