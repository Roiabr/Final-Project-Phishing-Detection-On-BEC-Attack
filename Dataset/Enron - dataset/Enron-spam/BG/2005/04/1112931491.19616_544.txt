FROM DR. MATTHEW OLAS
PRIVATE Email:ddrmtthwolas@yahoo.com

I am an Accountant in bank of Africa Benin(BOA). I was
also the personal Account Manager to Mr Sami Abdurbu, a
West Los Angeles, California, who used to work in an Oil company
here. On the 31th of Octomber 1999 my client, his
wife & their three children were involved in a an Plan
Crash, all occupants of the Flight unfortunately
lost their lives.
website:http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm>
Since then I have made several enquiries to many
US embassy offices to locate any of my client's
extended relatives, this has also proved
unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful
attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the
Internet, to locate any member of his family but all
in vain. I am now contacting you to assist in
repatriating the money and property left-behind by
my client before they get confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits
were lodged, particularly the BANK OF AFRICA BENIN.
The deceased had an account Valued at about
($8,250,000usd only)Eight million two hundred and
fifty thousand USDollars) has issued me a notice to
provide the next of kin to the deceased or his
account will be confiscated or decleared
unserviceable.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the
relatives for over 5 years now, I am now seeking
your consent to present you as the next of kin of
the deceased customer. All you should do is to apply
to the bank as the next of kin and I will be
furnishing you with any informations related to the
deceased inorder to make the transaction a succesful
one.
All I require is your honest co-operation to enable
us see this transaction through. I guarantee that
this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you & I from any breach of the law.
Please if this proposition is acceptable to you do
not hesitate to contact me fast.
My alternative
Thanks
Yours faithfully
DR.MATTHEW OLAS.
