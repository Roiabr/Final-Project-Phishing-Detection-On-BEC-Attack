Dear Sir, 
First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction; this is by virtue of

its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though I know that a 
transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I 
am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to

contact you by e-mail due to the urgency of this transaction. Let me start by 
first introducing myself properly to you. I am DR.DAN NKANGA, a Manager in 
advances department of the ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK LTD, Lagos. I came to know

of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a 
very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of 
money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence. I am not too really 
sure if you are my long lost contact whom I am trying to reach, but in anyway, 
please do take this message with a good heart and report back to me if you are 
not the person I think you are. I would explain more latter. 
THE PROPOSITION: 
A foreigner, late Engineer SANN CLARKE, an Oil Merchant / contractor with the 
federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a ghastly air

crash, banked with us here at ZENITH BANK Lagos, and had a closing balance of 
USD$27.5M ( Twenty Seven Million and Five hundred thousand, United States 
Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his 
available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited 
trust fund for the purchase of arms and ammunition at a military war college 
here in Nigeria. A fervent valuable effort has been made by our bank (ZENITH 
INTERNATIONAL BANK) to get in touch with any of the CLARKE family or relatives 
but all have proved to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of 
not going to be able to locate any of late Engr. SANN Clarke’s next of kin, 
wife or children that our Chairman and board of directors have decided to 
declare the funds (UNCLAIMED) and then be subsequently donated to the 
discredited Trust Fund for the purchase of Arms and Ammunitions for war in 
Africa against other continent in the world. In order to avert this negative 
development, myself and some of my trusted collaborating colleagues here at the

bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as late Engr. SANN Clarke’s

next of kin so that the funds could be subsequently transferred into your bank 
account as the beneficiary’s next of kin. All documents and proves to 
authenticate you as the rightful next of kin to the beneficiary will be 
carefully arranged such that the deal will be a 100% risk free involvement. For

your assistance and collaboration , your commission will be 20%, 75% shall be 
for myself and my collaborating colleagues for investment purposes in your 
country while 5% will be set aside for any expenses that would be incurred in 
the process of the transfer. 
If this proposal is OK, and you do not wish to take advantage of the trust we 
hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get to me immediately via 
my most exclusive e-mail: nkanga2@portugalmail.com   furnishing me with your 
most confidential telephone, fax number and exclusive e-mail so that I can 
forward to you the relevant details of this transaction.
Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation 
Best regards and God blessings, 
DR Dan Nkanga (ZENITH INTL BANK LTD).
Lagos - Nigeria.
