HSBC BANK LONDON

5th Floor Cannon Bridge House
25 Dow gate Hill London
EC4R 2SB United Kingdom
From=3A Mr wright cole


ATTENTION=3A RE=3A NEXT OF KIN ANDY COLE


I am Mr wright cole=2C a Jamaican born British citizen and account office=
r
to Late Mr=2E ANDY COLE=2C a UNITED STATE nationality=2C who used to work=

with a development/Construction Company Chelsea Construction
Company here in London=2E On 21st April 2001=2C our late customer Mr=2E A=
NDY
COLE was involved in a ghastly motor accident with his family northwards
to Leeds during which he lost his life with his wife and two Children=2E



Unfortunately=2C since we got the information about his sudden death and
the ugly incident that occurred=2C the management of my bank made several=

enquiries to Locating any of his extended relatives who can stand as his
Next of Kin to inherit an estate he left behind in our custody but
all these several efforts also proved unsuccessful and yielded no results=
=2E


As his personal account officer/mentor=2C I also made concerted efforts
aimed at locating a possible Next of Kin to my deceased client but my
personal endeavours also turned futile=2E

After these several unsuccessful attempts=2C I decided to track his last
name over the Internet=2C to locate any possible member of his family
hence I contacted you=2E

What I actually want to do is to present you to my bank as a Next ofKin
to the deceased Client of mine to enable us place claims on a total sum
of (=A33=2E6=2EMillion pounds)=2C he deposited in my good bank for safe k=
eeping
before his untimely death=2E

I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the stated sum he left
behind before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the
bank=2EThis intension becomes very urgent due to the fact that the bankin=
g
laws and policy here in London stipulates and provides that if such funds=

remains unclaimed after three years=2C that the Bank is legally empowered=

to freeze such accounts and the fund transferred into the Federal
Reserve Account as unclaimed Fund=2E

Recently the HSBC Bank London issued a notice of confiscation=2C as the
account had remained unserviceable since 2001=2C I was subsequently given=

a mandate of 21 official Banking days to produce a Next of Kin to the
deceased or consider the Account frozen=2E Due to time constrain and the
fact that I was unsuccessful in locating any relative to my Client=2C I
then wish to seek your Consent to present you as the Next of kin to the
deceased client of mine since you have similar Surname with the deceased
so that the proceeds of this account valued at (=A33=2E6=2EMillion pounds=
) can
be released through you for our general benefit instead of allowing his
sweat get lost in the Bank=2E


Be informed that I have in my possession all necessary information that
we shall require to back-up our claims=2E I shall furnish you with furthe=
r
details as soon as you have indicated your interest to render the
desired assistance=2E

Feel free to contact me on my private email address stated as follows=2C
to enable us commence actions on this deal instantly=2E Your
genuine/honest cooperation is required to enable us achieve this purpose=3B=



I guarantee that the entire transaction will be executed under a
legitimate arrangements=2E

Thanks


Yours truly=2C

Mr wright cole
