My Name is MIKE MUBA a citizen of Sierra Leone I am writing to solicit yo=
ur
noble assistance for the transfer and investment of U.S.D$15 million doll=
ars
(fifteen million U.S dollars) in your country. I am the son of late Army
General JOSEPH MUBA of the Sierra Leone. A National Army who died in dete=
ntion
early last year 2003 as a result of coups and counter coups in Sierra Leo=
ne.
My father before his death was director in charge of military arms and ar=
mory
procurement. 

 Before his death early last year, he called me confidentially and inform=
ed
me in confidence of this sum of USD$15 million dollars he deposited in a
security company in Accra-Ghana West African for security reasons and it
was marked as valuable items belonging to the family. He told me that he
deposited this USD$15 million in ending of the year 2003 and that he used=

my name as his first Child as the next of kin. And he directed me where h=
e
kept the Deposit Certificate, he further advised me to search for a relia=
ble
partner overseas who will assist me retrieve and invest the money oversea=
s
in case he did not come out alive, unfortunately he died early last year.=



 Now, I am soliciting your kind assist once to help me receive this money=

and to assist me invest the money wisely as it is the only money left for=

the entire family now, pending guarantee of your faithfulness and co-oper=
ation.
Right now, I have all the documents with me here in Ghana where we are no=
w.
So, I look forward to be hearing from you so that we will proceed and as
soon as we receive the money, I will come down to your country to meet wi=
th
you, witness the investing of the money and for you to secure a residenti=
al
house for us. Finally I will go back to Sierra Leone to bring my mother d=
own
to your country, so as to begin a new life with my mother . Meanwhile, yo=
u
will be compensating with 20% of the total sum for your noble assistance.=

And I have also mapped out 5% for any Incur expanses made during the tran=
saction.

 Expecting to hear from you soonest.

Thanks and God bless you.

Best Regards, 

MIKE MUBA. 

For the family.
