<P><SPAN class=t>STTC Subsidiary, WholesaleByUs, Adds 100,000 More Products And 
Three More Portals</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=tt>Monday April 4, 10:04 am ET</SPAN> 
<P>
<DIV class=ar>BERNARDSVILLE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 4, 2005--SoftNet 
Technology (OTCBB Symbol: <A 
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=sttc.ob&amp;d=t">STTC</A> - <A 
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/h?s=sttc.ob">News</A><B>;</B> German WKN#: 
A0B7RZ) announced today that wholly owned subsidiary, WholesaleByUs (WBU), 
expanded product Distribution to three more portals - Smarter.com, Nextag.com 
and Yahoo Marketplace. Additionally, WBU added more than 100,000 products to the 
WBUshopping catalog bringing the total number of products for sale to well over 
500,000. 
<P>Smarter.com and Nextag.com are completely new portals that have been added to 
the WBU System of selling. While Yahoo is not new to the WBU System, the Yahoo 
Marketplace is. Yahoo Marketplace is separate and apart from the Yahoo store. 
These three new portals being added is just another step in the continued 
expansion of WBUshopping.com. While certain sites and search engines are 
selected to be added at certain times due to the impact on the sales for the 
Company, the ultimate goal is to expand the WBU System to a point where WBU will 
in essence have a presence in every corner of the internet. 
<P>In addition to the three portals, WBU has added 100,000 more products to the 
WBU catalog. This means that the products have been added into the WBU system 
but not necessarily turned live to be sold on every portal. However, through the 
technology changes that were made, these products will easily be rotated into 
circulation throughout the WBU System in a very short period of time. Having 
created the "WBU Catalog", products can be better managed and circulated based 
on inventory levels and availability. 
<P>Please visit our website at <A 
href="http://www.softnettechnology.com/">www.softnettechnology.com</A> for more 
information or call the company directly at 866-898-4842 (local 908-204-9911).
