Attention Please! Strictly Confidential!

Greetings,

With all due respect, I guess my letter will not embarrass you,since I 
have no previous correspondence with you. I strongly believed, I would 
not regret approaching you in this matter. I am Mr. Charles Brown, a 
solicitor at law and the personal attorney to late Mr. Francis 
Fichelle, a French national. Late Mr. Francis Fichelle is a private oil 
consultant/contractor with the shell petroleum development in Saudi 
Arabia, herein after shall be referred to as my client.

I have Avery urgent and mutual business relationship to propose to you. 
On Sunday 26 December 2004, at about 0100 GMT, an 8.9 magnitude 
earthquake occurs on the seafloor near ache in northern Indonesia. This 
earthquake generated a huge tsunami wave, hitting the coasts of 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, India, Sri lanker, Maldives and 
even Somalia. 

Unfortunately, my client and his wife with their three children lost 
their lives in the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami 
that hit many part of Asia and east Africa. 

Since then, I have made several enquiries with his country? Embassies 
to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved 
unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to 
personally contact you with this business partnership proposal. I have 
contacted you to assist in repatriating a huge amount of money left 
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the finance and Security Company where this huge 
deposit was lodged. 

The deceased had a deposit valued presently at $12,000,000.00 million 
us dollars (twelve million united state dollars) and company has issued 
me a notice to provide his next of kin or beneficiary by will otherwise 
have the account confiscated within the next ninety working days.

Having been unsuccessful in locating any of my late client relatives 
for one (1) month now. I am now seeking your consent to present you as 
the next of kin/beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of 
this account valued at $ 12 million United States dollars can be paid 
to you. It is not necessary to be a blood relation to late Mr. Francis 
Fichelle, neither is it necessary to bear the same surname with him. It 
is even not important for the stand-in next of kin to be a French 
national.

Already, I have worked out modalities for achieving my aim of 
appointing a next of kin as well as transfer the money abroad for us to 
share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% to you. It is my intention to 
achieve this transfer in a legitimate way, all I required is your 
honest, co-operation, confidentiality and trust to enable us see this 
transaction through. 

The money transfer paper work itself will include a certificate of 
origin so that the receiving bank does not ask question. Also the paper 
work will include proper certificate that the fund being transferred is 
from non-criminal sources. 

In short this will be a proper and legal money transfer with apparently 
no risk involved. The transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any 
problem. As soon as I hear from you, I shall provide you with further 
clarification that you may need. Your urgent response will be highly 
anticipated and appreciated. 

Best wishes,

Charles Brown.

Note: in the event you are not willing to assist, kindly notify me to 
prevent me from making further contact
