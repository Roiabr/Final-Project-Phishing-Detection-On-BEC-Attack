Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Ba|tic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petro|eum in
the deve|opment of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
ful|-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This |etter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regu|atory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development wil| be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi|li0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park will supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annual|y for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
electric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 milli0n for a
project this size.

deve|opment of renewab|e energy sources (RES) in Po|and through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative technologies, and the creation of
relevant policies, strategies and p|ans. To fu|fil| the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
