On November 17, 2004, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent

Persona| Gateway. The Yap International Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
a|| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca|ls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica|ly connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Personal Gateway from any ce|lu|ar or landline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa|

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,O0O 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||iOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellu|ar phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.
