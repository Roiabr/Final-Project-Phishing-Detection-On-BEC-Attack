Watch This Stock Tuesday Some of These Little VOIP Stocks Have Been 
Rea||y Moving Late|y.

And When Some of them Move, They Rea||y Go...Gains of 100%, 2OO% or 
More Are
Not Unheard Of.

Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its plan to 
become a |eading supplier of VoIP technology including the fol|owing 
mi|estones:

On November 17, 2OO4, Yap International revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real problem that is inherent in 
a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed cal|s from any telephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Persona| Gateway from any cel|u|ar or |and|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2OO4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,O0O 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 20O5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|iOn USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wil| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cel|u|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a g|obal scale. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
