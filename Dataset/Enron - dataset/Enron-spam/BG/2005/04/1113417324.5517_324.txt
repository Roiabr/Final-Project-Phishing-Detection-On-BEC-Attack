Added commentary:
True - Prices are elevated on the 'Spot Market', consumer prices are 
higher in Europe but due to larger State taxes. It is evident that the 
increases in the US are out of reasonable proportion to the Spot Market 
increases, unless on the other hand the Oil Companies are mandated to 
levy taxes. Probably, it  may be necessary for a one day work stoppage 
to force Govt. intervention. We would hope that this [Govt. intervention 
in the market] does not have to occur but the Oligopoly of Oil Companies 
are destroying the "market".

What the heck, it's worth a try.


Subject: FW: Gas War


Join the resistance!!!!  I hear we are going to hit close to $3.00 a
gallon by the summer and it might go higher!! Want gasoline prices to
come down? We need to take some intelligent, united action.

Phillip Hollsworth, offered this good idea: This makes MUCH MORE SENSE
than the "don't buy gas on a certain day" campaign that was going around
last April or May!
The oil companies just laughed at that because they knew we wouldn't
continue to "hurt" ourselves by refusing to buy gas.  It was more of  an

inconvenience to us than it was a problem for them.   BUT, whoever
thought
of this idea, has come up with a plan that can really work.

Please read it and join with us! By now you're probably thinking
gasoline priced at about $1.50 is super cheap. Me too! It is currently
$2.09 for regular unleaded in my town. Now that the oil companies and
the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the cost! of a gallon
of gas is CHEAP at $1.50- $1.75, we need to take aggressive action to
teach them that BUYERS control the marketplace....not sellers.

With the price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to
take action.  The only way we are going to see the price of gas come
down is if we hit someone in the pocketbook by not purchasing their gas!
And we can do that WITHOUT hurting ourselves. How? Since we all rely on
our cars, we can't just stop buying gas. But we CAN have an impact on
gas prices if we all act together to force a price war.

Here's the idea: For the rest of this year, DON'T purchase ANY gasoline
from the two biggest companies (which now are one), EXXON and MOBIL. If
they are not selling any gas, they will be inclined to reduce their
prices. If they reduce their prices, the other companies will have to
follow suit. But to have an impact, we need to reach literally millions
of Exxon and Mobil gas buyers.  It's really simple to do!!

Now, don't whimp out on me at this point...keep reading and I'll explain
how simple it is to reach millions of people!!

I am sending this note to about thirty people. If each of you send it to
at least ten more (30 x 10 = 300) ... and those 300 send it to at least
ten more (300 x 10 = 3,000)...and so on, by the time the message reaches
the sixth generation of people, we will have reached over THREE MILLION
consumers. If those three million get excited and pass this on to ten
friends each, then 30 million people will have been contacted! If it
goes one level further, you guessed it.....
THREE HUNDRED
MILLION PEOPLE!!!

Again, all You have to do is send this to 10 people. That's all.  (If
you don't understand how we can reach 300 million and all you have to do
is send this to 10 people.... Well, let's face it, you just aren't a
mathematician. But I am  ... so trust me on this one.)

How long would all that take?  If each of us sends this e-mail out to
ten more people within one day of receipt, all 300 MILLION people could
conceivably be contacted within the next 8 days!!!  I'll bet you didn't
think you and I had that much potential, did you!  Acting together we
can make a difference.

If this makes sense to you, please pass this message on. PLEASE HOLD OUT
UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE $1.30 RANGE AND KEEP THEM DOWN.
THIS CAN REALLY WORK.
