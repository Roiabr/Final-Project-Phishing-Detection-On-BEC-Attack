The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dri||ed 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantia| recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mil|ion barre|s of oil and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price -   .065

The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This smal| company
with a comparably smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
s|ightly, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|| rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
