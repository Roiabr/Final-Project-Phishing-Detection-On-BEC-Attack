The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and dri||ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mil|ion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price -   .065

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y sma|| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|l that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What will the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
decline
slight|y, you will sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|l real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
