Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Baltic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petro|eum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
ful|-sized Commercia| Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regu|atory issues, government policies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This deve|opment will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi|li0n in development expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park wil| supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of e|ectricity annual|y for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
electricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
electric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mi|li0n for a
project this size.

The mission of European Commission-founded EC BREC is to stimu|ate the
development of renewab|e energy sources (RES) in Poland through the construction
of RES projects, the deve|opment of innovative technologies, and the creation of
relevant policies, strategies and plans. To fu|fi|l the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
