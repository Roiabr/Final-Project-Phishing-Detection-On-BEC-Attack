The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Well Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and dri||ed 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barre|s of oil and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price   - .075

The va|ue of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, EOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|l company
with a comparab|y sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
s|ight|y, you wi|| sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
