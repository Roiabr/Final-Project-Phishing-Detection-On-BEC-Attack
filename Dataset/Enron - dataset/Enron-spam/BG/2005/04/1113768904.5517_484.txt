Good night

The principle of the Gothic architecture is infinity made imaginable.
The Tathagata speaks in accordance with reality, speaks the truth, speaks of what is, not otherwise. `Tathagata', Subhuti, is synonymous with true suchness.
Adapt or perish, now as ever, is Nature's inexorable imperative.

It is not fair to ask of others what you are not willing to do yourself.
When your work speaks for itself, get out of the way.
Men have a sufficient natural instinct for what is true, and usually do arrive at the truth.Absent in body, but present in spirit.
So neigh is grandeur to our dust,So near to God is man When duty whispers low, `Thou must',The youth replies, `I can'.

 Hokkien, Mandarin, and Taiwanese]
