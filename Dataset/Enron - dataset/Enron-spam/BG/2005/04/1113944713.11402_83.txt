Greetings Madam

Change happens in the boiler room of our emotions... so find out how to light their fires.
The artist does not see things as they are, but as he is.
Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is the key to it.

http://mirajk.net/DMMPvhfsZNWHk5CT2utam6RwD/BBAbMAsAJwcLTA0y.htm

We are still masters of our fate. We are still captain of our souls.
We have taken beauty and exchanged it for stilted voices.
Great minds think alike.There is always a certain meanness in the argument of conservatism, joined with a certain superiority in its fact
This human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of a religious belief

Sai gobe
