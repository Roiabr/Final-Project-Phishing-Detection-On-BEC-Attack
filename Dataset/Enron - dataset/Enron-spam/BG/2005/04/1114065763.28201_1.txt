    About Bob Eubanks</PRE>
<P>Bob Eubanks started his broadcasting career as a disc jockey, working at KACY 
Radio in Oxnard, California. In 1960, he joined the staff of Los Angeles' 
popular rock 'n' roll radio station, KRLA, where he remained for eight years. 
Eubanks, along with such other notables as Charlie O'Donnell, Wink Martindale 
and Casey Kasem, made the station #1 in Los Angeles and, many felt, in the 
country. 
<P>While a career as a recording artist eluded him, Eubanks was actively 
involved in the musical careers of some very popular recording artists, 
producing the live concerts for the Beatles (three years of the band's Southern 
California concert dates), The Rolling Stones, Barry Manilow, Elton John and Bob 
Dylan, among others. He gained great notoriety while promoting the Beatles 
concert at the Hollywood Bowl. It was during the heyday of the 60s that he also 
launched a string of nightclubs for young adults called "The Cinnamon Cinder," 
showcasing such artists as Stevie Wonder, Ike and Tina Turner, the Beach Boys 
and the Supremes, just to name a few. 
<P>Chuck Barris Productions then hired Eubanks to host their new relationship 
game show, "The Newlywed Game," which premiered on ABC's daytime schedule on 
July 11, 1966. The following January, the show was added to ABC's prime time 
lineup, where it would lead the network's drive to prime-time game-show success 
for five years. "The Newlywed Game" was ranked among the top three daytime game 
shows from October of 1968 through April of 1973, and was among the top three 
rated prime-time game shows from October 1966 through April of 1971. His 
producer credits include: "The Tony Tennille Show," Buddy Hackett's "You Bet 
Your Life," "The Guinness Game" and "Infatuation." Eubanks also participated in 
the production of the motion pictures "Payback" and "Forced To Kill. Each year 
Eubanks can be seen hosting "The Hollywood Christmas Parade" with co-host Leeza 
Gibbons for KTLA-TV, Los Angeles.
