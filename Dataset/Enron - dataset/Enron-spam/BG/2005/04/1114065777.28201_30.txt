Dearly Beloved One,


I am Mrs.NINA DAVID,from Kuwait.I am married to late Mr Samson DAVID, 
who worked with KuwaitEmbassy in Ivory Coast for Twenty-Seven years 
before he died in the year 2001,after a brief illness that lasted for only 
five days. We were married forNine years with a duaghter (Lilian)who 
later died in a motor accident.

Before the untimely death of my husband,we were both born again 
Christians. Since after his death I lost happiness,and decided not to remarry 
or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. 

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of(US$2.2M)(Two 
million, Two Hundred Thousand UnitedStates Dollars) in a General Trust 
Account with aprime bank in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire. Presently ,this money is still with 
the bank. Recently,Following myill health, my doctor told me that I may 
not last for the next seven months despite all that is my possesion due to my cancer 
problem.The one that disturbs me most is my severe stroke sickness.

Having known my condition I decided to donate thisfund to a Christain 
organization (Church) that willutilize this money the way I am going to 
instruct herein,according to the desire of my late husband before his death.

I want this fund to be used in Christain Activitieslike,Orphanages, 
Christain schools, and Churches forpropagating the word of God and to 
endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that 
"Blessed is the hand that giveth",and there is happiness in giving than in 
receiving. 

I took this Bold decision because I don't have any childthat will 
inherit this money and my husband relativesare not Christians and I don't 
want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. 

I don't want a situation where this money will be usedin an ungodly 
way. This is why I am taking thisdecision. I am not afraid of death hence 
I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the 
Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that "the lord will fight my case and I shall 
hold my peace".

I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my 
health hence the presence of myhusband's relatives around me always.I 
don't want them to know about this development.With God all things are possible. As 
soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in 
Abidjan. I will also issue you the documents that will prove you the present beneficiary of  this fund. 

I want you and the Church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. And i know my destinaton whoever that wants to serve the Lord  must serve him in 
spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful for me and others.Pls do send your reply through this below email box:ninadavid20000@yahoo.com.

Yours in Christ, 
Mrs,Nina David
