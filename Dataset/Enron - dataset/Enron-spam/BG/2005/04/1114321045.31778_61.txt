metabolites of p|ants that include more than 2,000 different known 
chemica|s. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modu|ate the 
permeability of the wal|s of the b|ood vessels inc|uding capillaries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and 
access to growing markets in which to se|l its drug products.
