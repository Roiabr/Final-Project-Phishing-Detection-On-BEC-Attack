      website and newsletter are forward-looking statements that are made 
      pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Reform 
      Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks

      and uncertainties include, among other things, product price volatility, 
      product demand, market competition and risk inherent in the companies 
      operations. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not 
      relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as 
      ``anticipate,'' ``estimate,'' ``expect,'' ``project,'' ``intend,'' 
      ``plan,", "anticipate", "guess", "think", "hear", "suggest", ``believe,''
