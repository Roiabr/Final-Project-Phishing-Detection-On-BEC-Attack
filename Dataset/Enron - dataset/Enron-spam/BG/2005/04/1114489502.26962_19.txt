Dear friend, 
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I 
Believe everyone will die someday. My name is Ahmed Raheem, a
merchant in Dubai,in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with lung cancer.
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have 
onlyabout
a few months to live,according to medical experts. I have not
particularly lived my life so well,as never really cared for anyone (not
even myself)but my business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous,
I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that 
was
the onlything I cared for.
But now I regret all this as now know that there is more to life than 
just
wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God 
gives
me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a 
different
way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me,I have willed 
and
given most of my
property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well
as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my 
soul
so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as i want this
to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have 
distributed
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia.
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself 
anymore.
I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and 
distribute
the money which I have
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused
and kept the money to themselves.
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not
to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money,
which no one knows of, is the cash deposit of Ten million five 
hundredUS dollarUS ($10,500,000),
that I have with a security company abroad.
Acknowledge this mail so that I can introduce you to my lawyer who will
handle the transfer of receivership by you of the said funds.
 I will want you to help me collect this deposit
cash and use it for charity organizations only.
Thanks.
God be with you
Ahmed Raheem
