&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
        Stonebridge Resources Exploration Ltd. (NASD pink: SBGX), is a Nevada 
        corporation listed on the Nasdaq pink sheets. The company is focused on 
        resource acquisition and development for interests located primarily in 
        Canada and the United States. The company has begun an intensive 
        campaign to acquire and develop high value base metals, gold and rare 
        earth bearing properties. The company has a strategy to acquire a large 
        number of high value properties and begin development of them commencing 
        immediately. The initial target acquisitions all have very high 
        potential for moving into production and produce substantial income and 
        profits. A private funding group has agreed to finance acquisition and 
        development of the initial properties under friendly terms which involve 
        a working interest in the properties and equity in the company.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><i><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Value 
        Proposition</font></b></i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
        Stonebridge Resources has a highly talented management group with many 
        years of experience in resource property development. The target 
        portfolio of initial acquisition candidates has a diverse and robust mix 
        of deposits, some of very high value. One target acquisition, for 
        example, has a large deposit of Scandium. Scandium is a very expensive 
        rare earth material which has been used by the Russian materials 
        industry in alloy with aluminum to coat the surface of aircraft. 
        Currently there is no Scandium mined in the free world, and the property 
        that Stonebridge plans to develop contains large reserves of Scandium 
        and Titanium. The company plans to develop properties with many diverse 
        resources such as copper, gold, zinc, talc, platinum and palladium 
        amongst others. </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
        Stonebridge has an initial plan to acquire at least ten and as many as 
        twenty valuable mining properties within a very short timeframe. In the 
        next several months SBGX plans to control at least a dozen high-value 
        mining properties with the potential to bring in many millions of 
        dollars of profit to the company. The exact extent of the potential 
        revenues is as yet undermined because, although most of the candidate 
        properties have known reserves, more exploration and drilling needs to 
        be conducted in order to determine the minimum value of the mining 
        operations once acquisition is complete. Even after exploration, the 
        potential exists to uncover undiscovered reserves with the potential to 
        multiply the known value of the candidate acquisitions.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
        target acquisition is about 10 kilometers southwest of Timmins, Ontario. 
        The property already has indicated probable reserves of 100,000 ounces 
        with grades of 0.3 ounces per ton. This medium grade ore in large volume 
        constitutes a substantial deposit. Exploration is ongoing at the site 
        and the company already has a joint venture partner lined up for 
        development once the acquisition is completed. The company has a 
        strategy to develop properties in joint ventures with large mining 
        interests. This strategy allows the company to leverage its capital and 
        proceed with development quickly on all properties simultaneously. The 
        company has at least ten gold bearing sites under review for acquisition 
        at this time.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b><i>Conclusion:</i></b></font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
        Stonebridge Resources is building a large and well funded mining concern 
        with substantial acquisition properties in various stages of 
        development. The strategy of developing diverse properties with various 
        types of rare earth, gold and mineral deposits insures that there is 
        robust and lasting value built into the company. Moreover the chances of 
        uncovering greater value as development continues increases as the 
        variety and extent of the deposits become fully known. Stonebridge plans 
        to develop these properties and get them into production as soon as 
        possible.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        company is well funded by investors who care for the long-term viability 
        of the company and who will act in the best interests of the 
        shareholders. GMCR expects that Stonebridge will realize sizeable 
        profits of many millions of dollars from the development of these 
        initial candidate properties. Moreover, GMCR expects that the company 
        will continue to expand through acquisition and become a major mining 
        concern throughout North America.</font></td>

        The objective of the company is to become a respected leader in the 
        exploration and development in the resource and mining sector. Our 
        primary objective will be to acquire properties of merit, primarily in 
        North America. Focus being:</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        company will operate in a series of five distinct operational phases 
        working simultaneously in conjunction with one another.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>
        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Phase One:</i></font></b> 
        Operations will be focused on the acquisition of a significant portfolio 
        of properties of merit described in the overview. It is our intention 
        not only to acquire such assets but to secure the acquisitions. </font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>
        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Phase Two:</i></font></b> 
        Our operations will require contracting qualified personnel to perform 
        feasibility studies on each acquisition and to recommend potential high 
        probability target areas. During this stage we will allot and expend 
        sufficient capital on engineering reports, line cutting and sampling, 
        prospecting and preliminary drilling. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>
        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Phase Three:</i></font></b> 
        This will be the most capital intensive stage of the overall program. 
        Our focus will be directed on high probability targets with the goal of 
        bringing the property into development and production. This will 
        probably require us seeking senior joint venture companies to share both 
        in the expenses and profit potential. This is essentially the goal of 
        every junior mining firm. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>
        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Phase Four:</i></font></b> 
        During this period we will actively seek out other junior mining 
        companies as joint venture partners. This will be mainly for 
        acquisitions that we have been unable to fully explore and develop. For 
        maintaining an interest in the project we will assign the assets to a 
        junior exploration public company in exchange for shares. We will 
        maintain an active interest in the project but would prefer to have our 
        partner take the lead in exploration and development of the property.

        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Phase Five:</i></font></b> 
        Acquisitions that were either sold or exchanged on a joint venture 
        program to other firms in exchange for shares, we will dividend out the 
        shares received to all of our existing shareholders once the shares 
        become free trading.</font></td>
