The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|l market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the development of dri|ling programs in Wyoming (USA), as well 
as A|berta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that 
include existing production, are developing rapidly. Emerson wil| 
announce further detai|s as |ease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri|ling 
programs involves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, as 
well as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current dea| flow it will be able to bui|d a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing all possib|e 
0ppOrtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we wi|| have the 
0pp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dri||ing program, which 
wil| always encourage the participation of financial partners."


Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .O9

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This smal| company
with a comparab|y sma|l market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
decline
slight|y, you wil| sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area will rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
