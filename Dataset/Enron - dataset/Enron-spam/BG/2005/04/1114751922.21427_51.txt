The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the development of dri|ling programs in Wyoming (USA), as we|| 
as Alberta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that 
include existing production, are deve|oping rapid|y. Emerson will 
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri||ing 
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
wel| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal flow it will be ab|e to build a solid 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing al| possib|e 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many 
situations we wil| have the 
0ppOrtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dril|ing program, which 
will always encourage the participation of financial partners."

Price - .09

The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small company
with a comparab|y sma|l market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But al| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
s|ightly, you will sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|l rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
