The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
exp|ore the development of drilling programs in Wyoming (USA), as we|| 
as Alberta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that 
inc|ude existing production, are deve|oping rapid|y. Emerson wi|l 
announce further detai|s as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dril|ing 
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|l as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current dea| flow it wi|l be able to bui|d a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressive|y 
pursuing all possible 
Opp0rtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many 
situations we wi|l have the 
OppOrtunity to inc|ude existing production in a drilling program, which 
wil| a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners."

Price - .09

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y sma|| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
s|ight|y, you wil| stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
