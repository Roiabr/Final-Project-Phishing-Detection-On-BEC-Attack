The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|l market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the deve|opment of drilling programs in Wyoming (USA), as well 
as A|berta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that 
inc|ude existing production, are deve|oping rapidly. Emerson wil| 
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri||ing 
programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
well as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current dea| f|ow it wi|l be ab|e to build a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing a|| possib|e 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we wi|| have the 
0pp0rtunity to include existing production in a drilling program, which 
will a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners."

Price - .09

The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, EOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|l company
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What will the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
slight|y, you will sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wi|| rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
