ATTN:  CEO            

Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Although we never met before, I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. 

Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is HARRISON KARNWEA  from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My Cousin MR JOHN YORMIE  WINPOE, former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My Cousin was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. you can verify this from these international newspaper website below:

(i)   http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm


Before he was killed, my Cousin instructed me to escape with his family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG, SOUTH AFRICA, and he confided in me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name withheld for security reasons) . All i require from you is to assist me in claiming the fund (sealed in diplomatic consignment) from security company and invest in your country. When you claim the fund, i shall come over to your country with my Cousins wife and children so that we can start a new life

If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or why can't I take the cash transfer and myself? The answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my Cousin which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have access to the consignment in the company, and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund. 

My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way. On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you.In as much as you follow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the 
Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth $15Million,(Fifteen million  United State Dollars Only).

You will be given 30% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction. 

Kindly include your Full names, Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you. This proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality. Please reply to this email:karnwea@kaixo.com 

Sincerely, 

MR HARRISON KARNWEA
