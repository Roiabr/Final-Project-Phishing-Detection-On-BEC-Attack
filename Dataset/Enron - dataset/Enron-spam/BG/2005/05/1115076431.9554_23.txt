Hi

I have tried contacting you before in regards to the promised low
interest mortga(ge rate.

The good news is that you did qualify for the loan, for a rate of 4.2% !

You could receive over u380,000 for as little as i500 per month.

Ba(d credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what!
