This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it as fate and accept it with a deep sense of humility. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and trust-worthy person to whom I can entrust my last wish.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

Martinez; I am a 64 years old man, I am Cuban currently residing in Dubai. I was formerly living in Cuba and served under Castro’s government but had to run into self exile after the ruling Government of Fidel Castro closed in on my family on accusations of anti-government statements, I was once married with two children but my family could not escape before the deadly hands of Castro’s goons fell on them. </FONT></FONT></P>

Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for, I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family and hometown, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and some East European Countries. </FONT></FONT></P>

Use your judgment to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations.</FONT></FONT></P>
