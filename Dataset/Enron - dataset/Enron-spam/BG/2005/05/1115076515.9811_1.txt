<DIV><BR><STRONG>Overview</STRONG><BR><BR>Stonebridge Resources Exploration Ltd. 
(NASD pink: SBGX),  is a Nevada corporation listed on the Nasdaq pink 
sheets. The company is focused on resource acquisition and development for 
interests located primarily in Canada and the United States. The company has 
begun an intensive campaign to acquire and develop high value base metals, gold 
and rare earth bearing properties. The company has a strategy to acquire a large 
number of high value properties and begin development of them commencing 
immediately. The initial target acquisitions all have very high potential for 
moving into production and produce substantial income and profits. A private 
funding group has agreed to finance acquisition and development of the initial 
properties under friendly terms which involve a working interest in the 
properties and equity in the company.<BR></DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>Value Proposition</STRONG><BR><BR>Stonebridge Resources has a 
highly talented management group with many years of experience in resource 
property development. The target portfolio of initial acquisition candidates has 
a diverse and robust mix of deposits, some of very high value. One target 
acquisition, for example, has a large deposit of Scandium. Scandium is a very 
expensive rare earth material which has been used by the Russian materials 
industry in alloy with aluminum to coat the surface of aircraft. Currently there 
is no Scandium mined in the free world, and the property that Stonebridge plans 
to develop contains large reserves of Scandium and Titanium. The company plans 
to develop properties with many diverse resources such as copper, gold, zinc, 
talc, platinum and palladium amongst others. <BR><BR>Stonebridge has an initial 
plan to acquire at least ten and as many as twenty valuable mining properties 
within a very short timeframe. In the next several months SBGX plans to control 
at least a dozen high-value mining properties with the potential to bring in 
many millions of dollars of profit to the company. The exact extent of the 
potential revenues is as yet undermined because, although most of the candidate 
properties have known reserves, more exploration and drilling needs to be 
conducted in order to determine the minimum value of the mining operations once 
acquisition is complete. Even after exploration, the potential exists to uncover 
undiscovered reserves with the potential to  multiply the known value of 
the candidate acquisitions.<BR><BR>One target acquisition is about 10 kilometers 
southwest of Timmins, Ontario. The property already has indicated probable 
reserves of 100,000 ounces with grades of 0.3 ounces per ton. This medium grade 
ore in large volume constitutes a substantial deposit. Exploration is ongoing at 
the site and the company already has a joint venture partner lined up for 
development once the acquisition is completed. The company has a strategy to 
develop properties in joint ventures with large mining interests. This strategy 
allows the company to leverage its capital and proceed with development quickly 
on all properties simultaneously. The company has at least ten gold bearing 
sites under review for acquisition at this time.<BR></DIV>
<DIV><BR><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG><BR><BR>Stonebridge Resources is building a 
large and well funded mining concern with substantial acquisition properties in 
various stages of development. The strategy of developing diverse properties 
with various types of rare earth, gold and mineral deposits insures that there 
is robust and lasting value built into the company. Moreover the chances of 
uncovering greater value as development continues increases as the variety and 
extent of the deposits become fully known. Stonebridge plans to develop these 
properties and get them into production as soon as possible.<BR><BR>The company 
is well funded by investors who care for the long-term viability of the company 
and who will act in the best interests of the shareholders. GMCR expects that 
Stonebridge will realize sizeable profits of many millions of dollars from the 
development of these initial candidate properties. Moreover, GMCR expects that 
the company will continue to expand through acquisition and become a major 
mining concern throughout North America.</DIV>

<P><STRONG><SPAN class=t>Stonebridge Signs LOI to Acquire 50% Interest in Mining 
Claims of 6070205 Canada Inc.</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=tt>Friday April 29, 4:01 pm

<P>
<DIV class=ar>CARSON CITY, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 29, 2005--Stonebridge 
Resources Explorations Ltd. (NQB:<A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/164517/4952643">SBGX</A> - <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/164516/4952643">News</A>), has entered into a 
letter of intent with 6070205 Canada Inc. to Acquire 50% interest in the mining 
claims of their property in Northern Ontario, 15 km N.W. of Kirkland Lake. 
<P>The property was explored previously by a number of companies and previous 
drilling indicated geology finds that are favorable for a potential large 
sulphite deposit. 
<P>The initial drilling done in 1998 indicated zinc mineralization in a number 
of drill holes, varying from 0.6 meters of 4.4% zinc and 1.76% zinc over 4.6 
meters, 1.33% zinc over 4 meters. 
<P>In the year 2002 a megatem airborne survey was conducted over the property 
identifying several areas of interest. A confirmation of the geophysical result 
from the airborne survey was obtained by a ground geophysical survey that 
identified the down plunge extension of the previous drilling. It was 
recommended that a 3 drill hole program for a total of 500 meters be undertaken. 

<P>Harold Pizel, Stonebridge Resources President, said; "This agreement signed 
once again shows our strong belief and commitment to the mineral rich Northern 
Ontario region, we are excited about the opportunities ahead." 
<P>Stonebridge Resources Explorations Ltd. is a junior resource and exploration 
company concentrating on acquiring and consolidating large advanced 
exploration-stage companies with near term production potential and future 
growth potential and acquiring this growth initiative in a profitable and 
socially responsible manner.
