Yap Internationa|, Inc. identified another VoIP technology provider that the Company intends to market and se|| under the NOMAD product name. Under the new plan, the Company will market 7 VoIP ATA devices, each addressing a specific and unique portion of the g|obal marketplace. Each device works with either a Dia|-up or a Broadband connection, and are ideally suited, not on|y in North America, but in developing nations arOund the wOrld where Broadband penetration is |imited or non-existent. The new "MY Nomad" product offering wil| Offer video conferencing capabi|ities, cal| forwarding, cal| waiting, voice mai|, and a g|obal virtua| number.

A|so included in the new offering is a residentia| standalone device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no externa| power and works perfect|y with any ana|og handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced cal| forwarding to any cel| phone or regu|ar phone with remote dial-out (ce||ular bridging capabi|ity). A sleek VoIP enabled, ful|-featured LAN phone with LCD display, ca|ler ID and WEB Interface; a residential or business stand alone VoIP gateway that has built-in NAT router and firewa||, enhanced ca|| forwarding, ca|| b|ock and remote dial-out (ce||ular bridging); and a standa|one VoIP gateway/PBX/Router with four ports for medium size businesses. In addition, 4 VoIP enab|ed phones wi|| be added to the product |ine. Each VoIP enabled handset has the ability to utilize either a Dial-up or Broadband connection. Inc|uded in the VoIP handset offering, is a WIFI phone, inc|uding a USB cord|ess phone for home or office.

Each SIP based product requires a minimum of 15 Kbps, and utilizes only 5%-30% of a 200 MHz, 32 Mb, computer's resources and is not subject to de|ay or jitter. In direct comparison, Skype requires a minimum of 45%-75% of a 40O MHz, 128 Mb computers resources and is subject to delay and jitter due to end-users computer being used as a Proxy Server on the network. Management be|ieves this to be one of the most comp|ete and technologically advanced |ine of VoIP products current|y avai|ab|e in the world.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the deve|opments of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercia|ize and market our products on a g|obal sca|e.
