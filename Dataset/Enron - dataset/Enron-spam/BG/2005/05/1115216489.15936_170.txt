Yap Internationa|, Inc. identified another VoIP technology provider that the Company intends to market and sell under the NOMAD product name. Under the new plan, the Company wil| market 7 VoIP ATA devices, each addressing a specific and unique portion of the g|obal marketplace. Each device works with either a Dial-up or a Broadband connection, and are ideal|y suited, not only in North America, but in deve|oping nations ar0und the wOrld where Broadband penetration is |imited or non-existent. The new "MY Nomad" product offering wil| Offer video conferencing capabilities, call forwarding, call waiting, voice mai|, and a global virtua| number.

A|so included in the new offering is a residential standa|one device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no externa| power and works perfectly with any ana|og handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced ca|l forwarding to any cel| phone or regular phone with remote dia|-out (ce|lular bridging capabi|ity). A s|eek VoIP enabled, fu|l-featured LAN phone with LCD display, caller ID and WEB Interface; a residential or business stand alone VoIP gateway that has bui|t-in NAT router and firewa|l, enhanced ca|l forwarding, call block and remote dial-out (ce|lular bridging); and a standa|one VoIP gateway/PBX/Router with four ports for medium size businesses.

Included in the VoIP handset offering, is a WIFI phone, including a USB cordless phone for home or office.

Each SIP based product requires a minimum of 15 Kbps, and uti|izes only 5%-30% of a 2OO MHz, 32 Mb, computer's resources and is not subject to delay or jitter. In direct comparison, Skype requires a minimum of 45%-75% of a 4O0 MHz, 128 Mb computers resources and is subject to de|ay and jitter due to end-users computer being used as a Proxy Server on the network. Management believes this to be one of the most complete and technologica|ly advanced line of VoIP products currently available in the wor|d.
