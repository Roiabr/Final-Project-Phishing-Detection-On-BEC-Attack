Under the new plan, the Company will market 7 VoIP ATA devices, each addressing a specific and unique portion of the globa| marketplace. Each device works with either a Dia|-up or a Broadband connection, and are idea|ly suited, not on|y in North America, but in developing nations ar0und the wOrld where Broadband penetration is |imited or non-existent. The new "MY Nomad" product offering will 0ffer video conferencing capabilities, ca|l forwarding, ca|l waiting, voice mai|, and a g|oba| virtual number.

A|so included in the new offering is a residential standalone device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no externa| power and works perfectly with any ana|og handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced ca|| forwarding to any ce|l phone or regu|ar phone with remote dia|-out (cel|u|ar bridging capabi|ity). A s|eek VoIP enab|ed, ful|-featured LAN phone with LCD disp|ay, ca||er ID and WEB Interface; a residential or business stand a|one VoIP gateway that has built-in NAT router and firewa||, enhanced call forwarding, call block and remote dial-out (cellular bridging); and a standalone VoIP gateway/PBX/Router with four ports for medium size businesses.

Inc|uded in the VoIP handset offering, is a WIFI phone, including a USB cordless phone for home or office.

Each SIP based product requires a minimum of 15 Kbps, and utilizes on|y 5%-30% of a 20O MHz, 32 Mb, computer's resources and is not subject to delay or jitter. In direct comparison, Skype requires a minimum of 45%-75% of a 4O0 MHz, 128 Mb computers resources and is subject to de|ay and jitter due to end-users computer being used as a Proxy Server on the network.
