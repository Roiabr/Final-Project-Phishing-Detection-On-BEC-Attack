     Gambling in America has deep cultural roots and exists today as a widely available and socially accepted recreational activity.

It is estimated that in 1997 they collectively wagered more than <STRONG>$ 551 billion</STRONG>. This market has increased the intensity of competition for gambling among state-sponsored lotteries and commercial gambling enterprises, leading to legalization in some states in which gambling had previously been voted down. Presently, gambling in some form is legal in all but 3 states, casinos or casino-style games are available in 21 states, and 37 states have lotteries.</font></font><font size="2"><STRONG><br>
