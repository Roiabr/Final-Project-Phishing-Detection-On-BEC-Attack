 Dear beloved,
         ACT AS MY FOREIGN BUSINESS PARTNER
 
 Greetings from me and my family,Getting your contact
 was not an easy  task since I am not too computer literate,
 but due  to the absolute  confidentiality needed for the successful
 consummation of this  transaction,
 
 i decided to seek by myself through email directory
 where i got your  email  contact.I am contacting you on the hope that you  
will gladly assist me  and  also keep everything to yourself because of the  
sensitive nature of  this  transaction.
 My name is MR JANG DOO-HWAN, The brother of Mr. CHUN
 DOO-HWAN, the  former President of South Korea who seized power in
 a  military coup  in 1979 and who ruled from 1979 to 1987.
 
 My brother was pushed out of office and charged with  treason ,corruption and 
embezzlement of over  21billion won.
 
 He was wrongly sentenced to death but fortunately
 AMNESTY  INTERNATIONAL stepped in and commuted the sentence
 to  life,  We thank God that he has finally being released
 though still under  house arrest in the sense of conditions of the
 freedom.
 
 During my brother's regime as president of South  Korea, we realized  some 
reasonable amount of money from various deals  that we
 successfully executed, I have plans to invest this  money for my children?s 
future on real estate and  industrial production.
 
 Before my brother was overthrown, I secretly  siphoned the sum of
 $40,000,000 million USD (Forty million United states
 dollars) out  of Seoul and deposited the money with a security
 firm  that  transports valuable goods and consignments through
 diplomatic means.
 
 I am contacting you because I want you to deal with
 the Security  Company and claim the money on my behalf since I
 have  declared that  the consignment belongs to my foreign business
 partner.
 
 You shall also be required to assist me in  investment  in your
 country, I hope to know more about you as i need to  trust you as a God  
fearing  person  who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather 
assist me properly, I expect you to declare  what percentage of the total 
money you will take for  your assistance by negotiation.
 
 When I receive your positive response I will let you  know where the  
Security Company is and the payment pin code to  claim  the money
 which is very important.
 
 What i need is to indicate your interest that you  will assist me by
 receiving the money on my Behalf in Europe.For this, you shall be 
 considered  to  be the beneficiary/recipient of the money.
 
 The project in brief, is that the funds with which i  intend to  carry out my 
proposed investments in your Country  is presently in the custody of a 
Diplomatic Courier  Services Company in Europe.
 
 I cannot do this myself because i do not have  any relatives  living outside 
South Korea and moreover i do not  want the  government of my Country to know 
about the money  because they will  believe I got the money from my brother 
while he was  still in office as president.
 
 As soon as you are able to secure this funds out of  the firm, i intend  to 
use my own  share in acquiring some estates abroad for the
 future of my children.
 
 For this too you shall also be our family overseas  manager  of all our  
properties and you will be paid based on a certain  percentage agreed  on by 
both parties.
 
 For now, let all our communication be by e-mail for  security and safety  
reasons.
 
 Upon all, also send me your telephone and fax  number.
 to enable me to always place  calls through to you if the need arises at my  
convenient so as to avoid  the case whereby people will be listening to our  
conversation.
 I will ask my son to contact you and work hand to  hand with you after I have 
receive a response from you.
 
 I am going to introduce you to my son as an age long
 friend so as to  prevent him from knowing the beginning of our
 relationship as he may  disclose  this confidential transaction to any of his 
own  friends who are always  around  him probably for financial gains and  
treacherous if  he gives them the opportunity.
 
 This I got from the experience I had when the people  turned against
 Chun, my brother that became the prelude of our  sorrow. The reason
 why it took this long was that the Security  Company?s
 agreement with  me was that my brother must personally sign the
 Power  of Attorney  that will transfer title to the prospective
 beneficiary. It was a  long wait but it paid off.
 
 His excellency, Chun Doo-Hwan does not want to be  personally  involved for 
security reason.
 
 Your quick response will be highly appreciated.
 
 Thank you in anticipation of your cooperation.
 
 Yours faithfully,
 
 MR JANG DOO-HWAN
