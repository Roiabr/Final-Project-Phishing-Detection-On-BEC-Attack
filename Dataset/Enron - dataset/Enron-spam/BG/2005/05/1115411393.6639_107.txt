ATTN:THE PRESIDENT/CEO 
FROM:DR. FRANK  ALUKO

Dear Sir, 

I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and
success in your pursuits particularly  through my proposal as contained
in this letter. 

Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore
you to treat with the utmost confidentiality as this is required for
its success and to have faith in this transaction,for opportunities
like this only comes to one once in a life time. 

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of
my country's Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in
diverting  some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of
the Apex  Bank of my country.In order to commence this transaction, we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated
account the said floating  funds. We are determined to conclude the
transfer before the end of this quarter of 2005. 

The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime
 in my country,government officials set up companies and awarded
 themselves  contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various
ministries and  parastatals.The present civilian government set up the
Contract Review Panel, which  has the mandate to use the instruments of
payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to
review these contracts and  if necessary pay those who are being owed
outstanding amounts. 

My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds
which are presently floating in our (Apex) Central Bank  ready for
disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes.
However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of
 this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names
 of companies that are based in my country. 

I have therefore been mandated,as a matter of trust by my colleagues in
the panel, to look for a reliable  overseas partner into whose account
we can transfer the sum of U.S.$20,500,000.00  (Twenty million, five
hundred thousand U.S. dollars).That is why I am  seeking your
assistance. We have agreed to share the money to be transferred  into
your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows; 
(i)25% to the account owner(you). 
(ii)65 or us (the panel officials). 
(iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us)
incidental  to the actualization of this project. 
We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign
stock markets and other viable business till we are ready and able to
have access  to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please
note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. 

We intend to effect  the transfer within fourteen (14)banking days from
the date of receipt  of the following information through the ifax
number stated above:Your company's name,address,telephone and fax
 numbers  we will use your company's name to  apply for the payment and
backdate the award of the contract in favour of your company. 

We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and  we
solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 

I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when
 I hear from you.

Please get in touch through my IFAX # 15094618096.OR my alternative
email address:crp_ng2005@yahoo.com 

Best regards, 
DR. FRANK   ALUKO
