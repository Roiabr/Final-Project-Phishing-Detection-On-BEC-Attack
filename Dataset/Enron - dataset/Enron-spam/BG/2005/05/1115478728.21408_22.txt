Dear Sir/Madam,

I will like to inform you that a letter of credit was opened by the 

payment office through their corresponding bank "CITIBANK NEW YORK" in 

favour of a contractor to pay its contract dues.

With my connection with the top ranking officers at the payment 

office,i need a trustworthy business minded person that i can liase 

with to form a partnership on this which will be to our advantage.I 

will arrange the necessary documents to effect whoever liases with 

me as a rightful individual or organisation with their contract dues being

 ready for payment. Iwill then arrange to have the Standly letter of credit 

re-assigned to your name as part/full payment 

of your contract fund.



As you might be aware that Standby letter of Credit is a cash 

instrument and can be liquidated to cash upon swift confirmation from 

bank to bank. I hereby advise you strongly to seize this opportunity 

and arrange for how we are going to reassign the SLC to your name. The 

SLC is for US$50million and a copy will be sent to you as soon as i 

make the neccesary papers in your name or organisations name for you to 

confirm from your bank.As soon as you are interested and i go through a 

little dicussion with you on how we do the sharing of the dividends and 

if we reach a final conclusion which of course favours both of us, i 

will connect you with the office in charge of the reassignment.







hoping to hear from you.





BEST REGARDS



JAMES JONES
