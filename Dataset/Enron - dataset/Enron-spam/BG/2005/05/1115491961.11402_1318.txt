FROM THE CHAIRMAN
WEST AFRICAN RELIEF AGENCY,

Sir,

With ultmost regard and hope for understanding,I wish to
solicit for your co-operation in this proposal.
First and foremost,Name:Mr Antonio IDRIS,the Chairman of
West African Relief Agency,here in West Africa.Our
Organization awarded a contract to a foreign company valued
at US$20.5m. The contract was not finally executed,but in
my capacity as the Chairman of the Organization, I
purported that the contract had been executed and I equally
gave the name of the company as SOFT PEDAL INTERNATIONAL.
The contract payment from our organization had been
floating for the past six months.My foriegn partner and
confidant in this type of business died in a plane crash in
Republic of Benin, Dated; Dec. 26, 2003.

And that is why I am contacting you to reprofile the fund
in your name and put claims to the money which the funds
are coming via private bank and this is a legitimate
transaction.You will be paid 10% for your "management fees"
60 % for me and my colleagues,20% for the Tsunami Victims
and 10% to cover the cost of the transfer. I am mainly
contacting you because my retirement from office will be
due soon and if I do not plan and put claims to the money,
I will loose the money to the agency as the
new chairman might call back the money. On my side here as
the Chairman,I will send all the authentic documents to the
fund to you for easy claim and transfer of the fund to your
account, while I come over for my share.If this interest
you, please do mail me.

Sincerly
Antonio Idris(Mr).
