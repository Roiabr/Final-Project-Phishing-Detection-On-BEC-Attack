Dear Beloved,

Thank you very much for your prompt response to 

my mail which has again 
reassured me of your reliability.

You must understand the fact that,my health 

condition would not permit 
me to handle this affair on my own and it is 

based on this i decided to 
contact you.Before we proceed with the execution 

of my will,i would 
want you to understand that,the trust which i 

have bestowed upon you at 
this juncture is enormous and you must not take 

undue advantage of 
this.

Be informed at this juncture that,this project 

will be 100% hitch free 
provided you adhere strictly to my instructions 

at every given point in 
time.

I want you to understand that,i have been cheated 

in the past by my 
relatives in whom i confided to help me 

distribute my assets and this 
time 
around,i would not want a situation whereby you 

do not use this fund 
for the actual purpose it is meant for.

You have been selected for this mission after 

series of prayers and i 
would not want you to let me down.If after your 

perusal,you feel that 
the amount of money which i am offering you for 

the expedition of this 
project is not satisfactory,i want you to feel 

free to inform me so 
that 
we can adjust it.

Beloved one,i am seriously counting on your 

support to reach out to the 
less privilledge which is my utmost desire.

You are therefore required to reassure me of your 

seriousness by 
furnishing me with the following details;

1. Your legitimate name

2. Your contact address(not p.o.box)

3. Your telephone number(cell if any)

4. Your fax number

5. Your area of specialization

6. Your Age

7. Your Marital status

On receipt of the above information,i shall 

immediately provide you 
with further details on how to claim the funds 

from the finance company 
which is in the Netherlands.

In your next email reply,i want you to outline 

all the various 
activities you would engage the funds into,just 

for me to be convinced 
that 

you 
are capable of handling this mission.

Note that,this mission would certainly take most 

of your time and it is 
based on this fact that i have agreed to offer 

you some money just to 
compensate you for your moral and financial 

assistance which you would 
be rendering during the execution of this 

project.

Please note that,time is of immense importance 

and you are free to ask 
me any question pertaining to the execution of 

this mission.
