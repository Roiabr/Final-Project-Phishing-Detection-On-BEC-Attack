come forward to lay 
claims for this money as theirs. We cannot release the fund from his
account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased
as indicated in our banking guidelines,
unfortunately, no family member nor relative has ever appeared to claim the
said fund.

Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to have you stand as next
of kin to the
deceased so that the funds (US$47,320,000.00 ) can be released and paid
into your account as the beneficiary's next of kin otherwise the fund will
be returned to treasury as unclaimed funds which will subsequently be
donated to the trust fund for arms and ammunition to further 
enhance the course of war in the World.

All documents to enable you receive this funds will be carefully worked out
by us as we already have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to
locate any of deceased beneficiaries, and more so we are assuring you that
this business is safe

business endeavor by furnishing me with the following;

this surplus shall be for us,while 30%
shall be for you and the remaining 5% shall be used to compensate either
