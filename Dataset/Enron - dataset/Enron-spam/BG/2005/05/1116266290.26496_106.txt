              REQUEST FOR URGENT ASSISTANCE/INVESTMENT. 

DEAR Friend, 

You may be surprised to receive this letter since you don't know me personally,
I am Mrs. MRS MACKINTOSH MALCOM SHENGI .A, the wife of late MR.Malcom Kenneth 
Mackintosh who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.I am writing from 
Zimbabwe. 

I got your address from the internet through the consultancy directory during my
 search for a reliable and honest person to transactthis business with.I write to 
solicit for your special assistance to a family shattered by a tyrannical government 
led by a dictator and his (ZANU-PF) ruling party- president RobertMugabe. 

Because of land and farm land crisis in Zimbabwe, the government secretly sponsored 
the war veterans and some irrate party members to disposess the land being occupied 
by white farmers.This action has led to the killing of some members of opposition 
party including my husband(Malcom Kenneth Mackintosh), For more information see this
site www.zimbabwesituation.com/farmilist.html, page 2 number 776 428 . 

But before the death of my husband, he anticipated some dangers and so he deposited 
the sum ofUS$15.4m (Fifteen million four hundered Thousand United States Dollars)in 
the name of our only son KENNETH JR ,with the help of reputable security company in 
SOUTH AFRICA with the intention of using it to open fertilizer manufacturing company 
among other companies in our neighbouring country (Swaziland)after his university 
education. 


On the 29th of June 2000, the war veterans and some supporters of (ZANU-PF)ruling 
party trooped into our compound and axed him(my husband) to death. Since then, they 
have been terrorizing my only son, KENNETH MACKKINTOSH, but he managed to escape to 
a neighbouring country, South Africa as a political asylum seeker(refugee).But his 
position in South Africa does not permit him to open an account or run any huge 
financial business. 

Subsequently, the South African development community (SADC) has continuously 
supported Mugabe's new land reform act. It is against this background that my son 
have decided to transfer my husband's money into a foreign account. 

That is why I want this fund to be transferred into your private account so that you
will assist him to invest it in your country. Hence,if you agree to assist us, 
we will offer you 20% of the money for your assistance, 10% will be for the possible
expenses incurred in the process of this transaction, while 70% will be for our 
family investment in your country through your assistance. I need your urgent and 
confidential response. 

Best regards, 
MRS Mackintosh Malcom .S. 
FOR THE FAMILY 

Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the 
informations that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with 
the security company in SOUTH AFRICA I will also send to you the agreement that 
will protect both interest. And also further information about yourself is necessary 
for i can not play on this.
