How would you like to have one dollar for every Dot com. Domain name that exists everywhere on planet Earth? Have you ever fantasized about having one dollar for every automobile that travels the highways in the entire world? Do you remember when 1-800 phone numbers were first introduced? Now there are no more 800 numbers available. You have 888's 877's etc. I wish I could somehow wave a magic wand and have you understand the HUGE income available to you via Global Domains International (GDI). I hope you are a visionary. Your total cost to participate is only $10 per month.
