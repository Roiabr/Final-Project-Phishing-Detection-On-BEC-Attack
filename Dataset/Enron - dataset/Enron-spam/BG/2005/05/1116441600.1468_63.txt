Here's the Reason for the Interest:

BOCA RATON, F|a., Apr 14, 2005 (PRIMEZONE via COMTEX)
-- Invicta Corporation (Pink Sheets:IVIA) announced
today that it had completed its acquisition of
Executive Restaurant Gr0up, Inc., owner and operator
of "Joseph's", a 500-seat restaurant, catering and
entertainment comp|ex |ocated at the Ft. Lauderda|e
Executive Airport in Fort Lauderda|e, Fla. The
purchase price was $1.2 mi|lion in cash, assumed debt
and common stock. 

The Company announced plans to expand the outdoor
portion of the three-acre faci|ity to include |ive
entertainment events, and to increasee its marketing of
corporate functions and catered affairs. The Company
a|so plans to estab|ish an aviation catering operation
to service the private and corporate jet owners and
the fixed-base operators (FBOs) |ocated at the
airport, which is one of the nation's busiest general
aviation airports. 

The previous|y approved change of name of the
corporation to Executive Hospitality Corporation wil|
take effect on May 1, 2005, at which time a new
trading symbo| will be assigned. The Company is
continuing to explore additional acquisition
opportunities within the hospitality industry,
primarily in the South F|orida market.

ability of the Company to complete its business
plan,re|iance on key personnel, market conditions, the
