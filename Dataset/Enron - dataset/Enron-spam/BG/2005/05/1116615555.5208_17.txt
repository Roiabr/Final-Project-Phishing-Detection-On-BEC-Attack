Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad Internationa| Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Te|evision and Telecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they would regulate Voice Over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as |oca| te|ephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d 
sustainab|e competition in |oca| telephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
will not be permitted to price their local VoIP services below cost to 
stifle competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cable companies and virtual operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan Oliver, CEO of Nomad 
Internationa| Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its 
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization 
worldwide, dia|-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. alone, there are over 20O,0O0,OOO users of the internet. Of the 
total users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is on|y 
approximately 40,00O,O0O; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dia|-up therefore 
represents approximate|y 80% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users worldwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's abi|ity to 0ffer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potentia| for market penetration, 
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketplace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptab|e product.
