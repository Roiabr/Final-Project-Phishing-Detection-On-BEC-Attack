Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad Internationa| Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Te|evision and Telecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they wou|d regulate Voice Over Internet Protoco| 
(VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as local te|ephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d 
sustainable competition in local te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wi|l not be permitted to price their local VoIP services below cost to 
stif|e competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cable companies and virtua| operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan O|iver, CEO of Nomad 
Internationa| Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the abi|ity of its 
products to Offer services to both broadband and dia|-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization 
wor|dwide, dia|-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. a|one, there are over 2OO,0OO,OOO users of the internet. Of the 
tota| users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is only 
approximate|y 40,00O,00O; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dial-up therefore 
represents approximately 8O% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's abi|ity to 0ffer VoIP products to dia|-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potentia| for market penetration, 
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketplace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easi|y adaptable product.
