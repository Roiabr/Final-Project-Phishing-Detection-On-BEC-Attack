<p>Dear friend, 
<br> My names are Daniel Mills. I'm a 65 years old man. I am british living in dubai 
( united arab emirate). I'm a merchant and owned two businesses in dubai. I'm 
married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six 
years ago. Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all 
I lived for.I never really cared about other values in life. 
<br>   But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless 
familes. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/ motherless homes. I have donated 
some money to orphans in sudan, south africa, cameroun, brazil, spain, austria, 
germany and some asian countries.
<br>  Before i became ill, I kept some money, twelve and a half million dollars $12.5million) 
to be precise in a long term deposit account in my account in london.Presently 
i'm in a hospital in South Africa. My doctors told me i have prostrate cancer 
that i have a few months to live.It is my last wish to see this money distributed 
to charity organizations. because so much of my wealth has been
<br>plundered by relatives and friends since my illness, I cannot live with the agony 
of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.Please, i beg you in the 
name of God to help assist me and my partners overseas to come to the aid these 
homeless children. use your judgement and help us help them.
<br>  Our new area of concertration is in nigeria and we have established a branch 
organisation.Please feel free to contact them via phone(234-8054000890, 234-8023321577), 
or via email <a href="mailto:hcfnigeria@yahoo.com.May">hcfnigeria@yahoo.com.May</a> God in his infinite mercy grant you the courage to answer our call and also 
aid the pockets you aid with. 
<br> 
<br>sincerly, 
<br>Daniel Mills</p>
