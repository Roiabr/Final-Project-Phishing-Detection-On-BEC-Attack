I believe you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country in the Internet.

My Name is MRS.SUZANA NUHAN VAYE from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My late Husband is Issac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia. My Husband was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA CHARLES TAYLOR&#41; from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:

(I&#41;http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm

Before my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5 million through a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a Security Company Abroad. And this money was meant for importation of agricultural machinery.

All that is needed is for my lawyer to instruct the company to transfer the funds to your account, I will remunerate you with 20% at the end, but most of all is that I solicit your trust and honesty in this transaction. I have been confined only to our country home and all my calls are monitored, so I will advise you to contact my private Attorney Barr.James Broderick base in United Kingdom on hiscontact stated below for onward proceedings: -
