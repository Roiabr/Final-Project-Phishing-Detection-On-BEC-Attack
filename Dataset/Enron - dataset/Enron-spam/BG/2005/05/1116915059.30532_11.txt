<DIV><BR><FONT face=3DArial>l am dating a much younger woman 
(21).&nbsp; Before we began dating I was hearing <BR>stories of

needed <BR>that same edge the younger guys were getting. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>25 mg is best for me and I have found that VlAGGRA 
makes me a super stud and <BR>the girl rides me and always has an 
orgasm or two. It has made me much better <BR>in bed and I give her 
some very long and extended foreplay now. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>It has 
really helped my confidence knowing that if needed I can give it to 
her any time she wants it. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>V. has to be the greatest
