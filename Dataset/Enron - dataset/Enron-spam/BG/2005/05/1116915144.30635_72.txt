Breaking News:  Relay Capital Corporation (RLYC)  has retained Corporate Network of Los Angeles to identify and negotiate business joint ventures, acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry. Several companies that currently hold transferable joint venture contracts have been identified by Corporate Network, and negotiations have begun on behalf of Relay Capital. 
Corporate Network currently is negotiating on behalf of Relay Capital with Ascot Investments, Inc. (www.ascotinc.com) to acquire specific stored value assets held by the firm. The acquisition contracts under negotiation includes a firm registered with MasterCard as a Member Service Provider that has MasterCard and Maestro-ATM pre-paid re-loadable cards, and another company with over 40,000 retail loading stations throughout North America. 
"Our goal is to provide Relay Capital with a wide range of the best possible solutions to offer their current and expanding client base," said Harold Gregg, CEO of Corporate Network. "We will continue to identify and execute agreements that provide Relay with new and expansive annuity based revenue streams that not only are in the stored value sector but at the forefront of communications and information technology." 
Relay Capital anticipates that the successful acquisition of these contractual assets, will enable it to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions. With Corporate Network's assistance, it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty.
