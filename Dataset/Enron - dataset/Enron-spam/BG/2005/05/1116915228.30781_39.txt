C O M P A N Y   O V E R V I E W
 
Vinoble, Inc. (VNBL.OB) is a holding company, which is identifying and 
acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland 
security, security information systems, and other security services to 
provide long term growth for its shareholders.

Vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in 
the security sector is unprecedented.

The terror attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001 have 
changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future. Both 
physical 
and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments, 
especially in the banking, healthcare and government sectors. While the 
focus for Vinoble is on North America, the opportunity for security 
services is worldwide. According to Giga, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Forrester Research, worldwide demand for information security products 
and 
services is set to eclipse $46B by 2005.

Vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security 
market by delivering professional services, security products, security 
training, and managed security services. In pursuit of this objective, 
Vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals 
offering a full range of security services. Through Vinoble's 
consulting services and integrated delivery solutions, Vinoble will 
help 
organizations protect key assets including persons, property, 
information, 
brand, and reputation. 

Homeland Security, the National Strategy for a Secure Cyberspace, the 
Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 
Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued 
increase in security demands in the United States and abroad. Vinoble 
intends 
to position itself as the 'most desired' provider of, both, physical 
and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients, 
alliance 
partners, and peers. We will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are 
the most knowledgeable, agile, professional, and cost-conscious 
provider of 'tailored' security solutions to meet the unique needs of 
each 
client.

Management has partnered with GarcyCo Capital Corp. ("GCCC") to assist 
in finding acquisition candidates for the company, structuring such 
acquisitions, and effecting a transition to corporate growth. At 
present, 
Vinoble and GCCC have targeted several companies as potential 
acquisition candidates. Pending the outcome of due diligence and 
audits, the 
company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis 
required for listing on a national exchange.

 
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 20, 20O5--Vinoble, Inc. (OTCBB: 
VNBL - News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities in the areas of homeland security, security information 
systems, and other security services, is pleased to announce that as it 
continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition 
of assets, businesses, and strategic partners in the RFID and GPS 
tracking sector, Vinoble has further engaged with several additional 
businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology, software, 
and patents. 

Following the move to acquire RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) 
technology, hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use 
applications, the Company has concluded that the need for application 
support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the 
framework which operates such technology. The Company has identified 
several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software, 
and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element. 

Middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications, both 
internally and externally, to the enterprise. This typically involves 
routing data using different transport protocols, translating data into 
different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as Web 
services and service-oriented architectures. 

Since RFID is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and 
non-mobile assets, user-friendly and efficient management software enabling 
customers to manage RFID data both incoming and out-bound is important 
in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with 
customer service. Management software will allow for real time visibility of 
assets or product inventory, whether in transit, in a warehouse, at the 
manufacturing plant, or on a store shelf. Visibility and accuracy will 
enable customers to reduce handling costs, gain instant access to 
shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply 
chain. The ability to manage data collection from a number of different RFID 
and GPS devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system. 

The Company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology 
will be essential and will further position Vinoble in the vastly growing 
RFID and GPS tracking industry. The Company's goal is to provide 
critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of 
businesses that can't afford to do without the safety of their personnel and 
assets in this current state of constant threat.
