Atten:CEO.
Dear Sir/Madam,           

You may be surprise to receive this letter from me as you don't know me in person, but please take this mail into consideration.Though,I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Zimbabwe but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is David Makume  from Zimbabwe, a Country in Southern Africa. My father Mr Johnson Makume,was a farmer in my country.My father  was  accused of sympathizing with white farmer against the wish our ruling government (Z.A.N.U.P.F)and all their allies (the war veteran) they killed him.You can verify this from these international newspaper websites.

Before he was killed, my father made a deposit with a security company in SOUTH AFRICA, and he confided in me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name withheld for security reasons).This money was for expansion of his farm business to other parts of Southern Africa.

All i require from you is to assist me in claiming the fund (sealed in diplomatic consignment) from security company and invest in your country. When you claim the fund,i shall come over to your country with my mother  and my siblings so that we can start a new life

If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or why can't I take the cash transfer and myself? The answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my father which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have access to the consignment in the company, and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged danger in the crisis that continued in our country (ZIMBABWE) and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund. 

My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way. On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you.In as much as you follow my instructions carefully,religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable.I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth Twenty Six Million,Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only,($26.5 M)

You will be given 30% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country.I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction. 

Kindly include your Full names, Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach,to enable me send some other important information across to you.This proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality. 

Please reply to this 

Sincerely,

David Makume
