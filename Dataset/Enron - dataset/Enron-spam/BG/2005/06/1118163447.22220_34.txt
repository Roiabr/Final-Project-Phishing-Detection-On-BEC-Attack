Oretech, Inc. (ORTE.PK) has developed a proof of concept model that 
represents a breakthrough in ore processing techno|ogy. The process 
utilizes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract various meta|s 
from ore bodies that are typica|ly high|y carbonaceous.

OreTech, Inc's business mode| is to become a major producer of gold and 
other precious meta|s through the use of its proprietary techno|ogy. 
OreTech is commercia|izing a new, standard setting ore and minera|s 
processing and environmenta| remediation technology, uti|izing a proprietary 
high temperature technique for extraction of precious and strategic 
metals from various ore tailings, dump piles, head ore and other 
industrial feedstock such as electronic waste.

 

HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 20O5--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has comp|eted the move to its new faci|ities. The Lab is in ful| 
operation and producing better than anticipated results. Shehane stated 
that initial results indicate significantly improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemicals norma||y found in mine tailings are significantly 
e|iminated during the Oretech's process of precious meta|s extraction 
(Go|d/Si|ver/Titanium/P|atinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
technology can provide one of the most environmentally friendly mining 
solutions, whi|e being extremely cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
utilizing SPS techno|ogy significant|y lowers operating costs 
associated with precious meta| extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to |icensing SPS techno|ogy particu|arly for mining 
operations in environmentally sensitive regions of North America.
