<P>
<DIV class=ar>CULVER CITY, Calif., June 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Small World 
Kids, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: <A 
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=swkd.ob&amp;d=t">SWKD</A> - <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/186491/4952643">News</A>), the parent company of 
Small World Toys, a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of established brands 
of toys for children, was a winner of iParenting Media's Excellent Products of 
2005 award program. The awards were for Tolo's First Friends Tractor and First 
Friends Trailer set. 
<P>iParenting Media is a premier media company focused on parents and 
grandparents, and reaches them through online, print and radio outlets. The 
evaluation process utilized by the iParenting Media Awards program has attained 
ISO 9001:2000 Certification from the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO). ISO 9001:2000 is an internationally recognized standard 
of quality assurance. 
<P>"Receiving this honor reinforces the value of the entire Tolo product line," 
said Debra Fine, CEO of Small World Kids, Inc. "Product quality, design and 
performance are, and always will be, our highest priority and we're very pleased 
that iParenting Media has recognized us for this." 
<P>"The iParenting Media Awards Program connects parents and grandparents with 
the very best products in the marketplace," said Alvin All, chief executive 
officer of iParenting Media. These award-winning products exceeded the high 
evaluation standards we set." 
<P>"We realize that winning this award strengthens our company appeal with the 
grandparent segment of the toy market. This segment represents a 3 billion 
dollar buying force. We know that grandparents resist purchasing trendy items 
and instead purchase classic toys and products like the Tolo brand that we have 
distributed for ten years. It is our commitment to distributing only the highest 
quality brands that made double digit revenue growth possible in 2004 and will 
help us to deliver on our revenue guidance of 15% for 2005," Fine concluded.
