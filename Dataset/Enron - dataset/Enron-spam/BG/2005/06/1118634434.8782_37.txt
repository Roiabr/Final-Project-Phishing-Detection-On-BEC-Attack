All my life I've wanted to be someone; I guess I should have been more specific.	Jane Wagner/Lily Tomlin (1939- )	. Those news announcers aren't practicing shaving next to the police station right at this time..
<br>
Did those news announcers dislike jumping?. A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing.	Oscar Wilde	.

Do just once what others say you can't do, and you will never pay attention to their limitations again.	-James R. Cook	. But this is where you come in: Between now and November, you, the American people, you can reject the tired, old, hateful, negative politics of the past. And instead you can embrace the politics of hope, the politics of what's possible because this is America, where everything is possible..
