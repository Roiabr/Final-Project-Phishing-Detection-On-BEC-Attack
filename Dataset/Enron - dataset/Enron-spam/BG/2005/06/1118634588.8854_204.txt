Confidential and Private Business Proposal

From: Mr.Liyanage Boga Doudou
Ivory Coast (Abidjan)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I know this mail may come to you as a surprise,considering the fact that we have
not known ourselves before.Nevertheless,i got to know of you during my eager
search for a reputable and reliable person who can assist me in a financial
issue of this magnitude.

My name is Liyanage Boga Doudou the Son of the interior minister Emile Boga
Doudou of Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory coast) who was killed in the September 19,2002
mutiny that equally lead to the death of former military junta Robert Guei.

I am contacting you because of my need to deal with persons whom my family and I
can lay trust and personal relationships on. Since the murder of my father, I
have been subjected to all sorts of harassment and intimidation with lots of
negative reports emanating from the Government and the press about my family.

The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are frozen and
all assets seized. It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and
assistance in the transfer of the sum of Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars (US$10,500,000.00) being the very last hope for my family
and I. After the murder of my father, the Federal Government seized all our
properties and our bank accounts local and international, all frozen.

My only hope now is the cash that my father carefully packaged and deposited as
Artifacts with a Security company outside (IVORY COAST).The said money of Us$
10.5M can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended beneficiary. The
security company based on my instructions will release the fund to you on the
fact that you will be presented as my oversea partner who will be fronting for
me in area of business you deem profitable.

To show my preparedness and appreciation to conduct this business with you, I
shall give you  20% of the total sum for your assistance,75% for me and my
family to invest in your country and a further 5% will be mapped out for any
expenses that we may incurred in the process of this transaction.

I need your full support and co-operation for the success of this transaction. I
plead with you to treat this issue confidential and urgent because it is
delicate and it demands a great degree of secrecy.

If my proposal interests you, please forward your reply including your telephone
number and fax number to my private email ( lbdoudou@mxs.de ) or (
ldoudou@eresmas.com ) or (lbdoudou@kaixo.com)  so that i can call you for more
clearification about the transaction.

I await your urgent response.

Yours Faithfully,
Liyanage Boga Doudou
