I made my original programs available to the teachers around me. They were getting the same kind of success. I finally decided I had to make my noun program available to teachers and parents around the nation. We have been working on it for over 2 years. Many of you have waited patiently. Thank you for your patience. Whenever you find you are on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.	-Mark Twain [Samuel Langhornne Clemens] (1835-1910)

Hello,
<br><br>
We tried contacting you awhile ago about your low interest rate.
<br><br>
You have qualified for the lowest rate in years...
<br><br>
You could get over $350,000 for as little as $300 a month!
<br><br>
Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what!
<br><br>
