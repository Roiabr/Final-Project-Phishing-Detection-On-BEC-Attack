How have you been, bruce@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org

Have you already loved sleeping?

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream.	Mark Twain [Samuel Langhornne Clemens] (1835-1910)	

Thanks,

Madelyn Smith
