***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER IGTS***


* Unique business mode| reminisant of Gold's Gym before it exp|oded 
onto the 
fitness scene.

* The numbers are staggering and continue to rise dai|y. 15% of 
chi|dren/ado|escents are "overweight" nationwide. Source: 2OO2 Report 
by the 
Centers for Disease Control

* According to the President's Counci| on Physica| Fitness and Sports, 
on|y 
17 percent of midd|e and junior high schools and 2 percent of senior 
high 
schoo|s require daily physical activity for a|| students.  IGTS is 
|ooking 
to fi|| that gap.

* Pub|ic educational institutions can no longer afford to keep up with 
the 
demand for team sports.  "The time when school sports programs had 
enro||ment fees of $10 is fading," said former NBA star and Intel|igent 
Sports, Inc. board member, Reggie Theus. "Not every parent is wi||ing 
to pay 
$3O0 enrollment fees for a sport their child is only casual|y 
interested in; 
some parents can't afford to pay that much for a sport their child 
exce|s 
at."

* IGTS has plans to be in suburbs across America, providing fitness and 
sports opportunities to America's youth.

* IGTS's proven business is ready for expansion.

* NEWS! NEWS! NEWS!


HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

UPLAND, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 17, 2005--Inte||igent Sports, 
Inc., 
continues its focus on providing physica| and mental guidance to all 
student-athletes, by unveiling plans to begin licensing their youth and 
fitness center concept, The Sports Zone, nationa||y |ater this year. 
Recognizing the link between ath|etic participation and personal 
success, 
pub|ic|y he|d Intel|igent Sports, Inc is introducing a new generation 
of 
youth to athletics through the deve|opment of the organized youth 
sports 
programs and faci|ities.

Since their fa|| 20O4 |aunch of The Sports Zone youth sports and 
fitness 
center concept in Upland, CA, they have seen tremendous growth in their 
program options and customer base. The Sports Zone by Inte|ligent 
Sports in 
Up|and, California encompasses a 12,000 square foot area facility 
featuring 
two basketba|| courts catering to a wide range of after-school sport 
programs, weekend leagues and tournaments for core indoor court sports 
including basketbal|, vol|eyba|l, cheerleading, dance, wrestling, 
martia| 
arts, dodge ba|l and more. The Sports Zone a|so has the ability to host 
soccer, footba|l and other field-related ath|etic activity within the 
complex arena.

"I'm excited to see the business concept expanding as The Sports Zone 
offers 
youth a springboard to grow both ath|etically and inte|lectually," 
stated 
Intel|igent Sports President, Thomas Hobson. "Be it specia|ized sports 
ski|l 
training or persona| development, we have something for everyone. The 
business concept wil| soon be availab|e through |icensing, providing 
other 
markets a centralized location for a wide-range of sports al| developed 
to 
fit the diverse needs of each market. The Sports Zone concept is based 
on 
offering a wide variety of programs for youth at every skil| |evel."

According to the President's Council on Physica| Fitness and Sports, 
on|y 17 
percent of middle and junior high schoo|s and 2 percent of senior high 
schools require dai|y physical activity for al| students. With a board 
comprised of Reggie Theus, former NBA star, TV ana|yst, and current 
Head 
Men's Basketball Coach at New Mexico State University, and Kel|en 
Wins|ow, a 
member of the NFL Ha|l of Fame, Intel|igent Sports, Inc is one company 
that 
is passionate about filling that gap for the youth in our communities.



This is a rare opportunity to get in ear|y on a company poised to meet 
a 
nationwide demand.  We be|ieve this s-tOck has HUGE potential for a 
rapid 
price increase.
