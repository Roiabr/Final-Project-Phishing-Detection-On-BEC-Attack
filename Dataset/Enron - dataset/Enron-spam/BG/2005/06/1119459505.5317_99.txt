Attn:SIR 

Dear friend, 

I am Mr.Kola Peters, Bank Manager of First Bank
Nigeria. PLC, Lagos Branch. 

I got your contact from the World Trade Center
(W.T.C.) Regional office in Lagos, Nigeria although
the details of my intention was not made known to
them. Actually, I know it will come to you as a
surprise because we have not met either physically or
through correspondence.I have a very urgent
and confidential business proposition for you for our
overall mutual interest. 

On June 6 2003,an American Oil Consultant/Contractor
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.
A Barton made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for
twelve Calendar months, valued at
USD$15,000,000.00(twenty-five million dollars) in my
Branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification
to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a
month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his
contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation that (Mr. A Barton )died from an
automobile accident. On further investigation I
found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempt
to trace his next of kin were fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that (Mr. A Barton) did not declare any next of kin in
all his official documents, including his bank deposit
paperwork. This sum of USD$15,000,000.00 is still
sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the principal sum at the end of each
year, No one will come forward to claim it.
According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6
(six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of
the Nigeria Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like
you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin of
(Mr.A Barton) so that the fruit of this old man labor
will not get into the hands of some
corrupt government officials. This is simple; 

1) I will like you to provide me immediately with your
full names, address, telephone/fax number. 

2) you will be ready to follow my instructions exactly
the way it is given to you in order not to make
mistakes. 

3) A bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin to (Mr
Barton) The money will be paid into your account for
us to share in the ratio of 75% for me and 20% for
you. 5% will be map out to cover any expenses incured
during the cause of transaction.
There is no risk at all as I will be directing you on
what to do and how to do it and with my position as
the Branch Manager I guarantees the successful
execution of this transaction depending on your
seriousness. 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more
details and Please observe utmost confidentiality, and
berest assured that this transaction would be most
profitable for both of us because I shall require your
assistance to invest
my share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent reply through the above emaill
address, and please save me the anxiety of endless
waiting. 

God bless you. 

Mr.Kola Peters.
First Bank PLC,
Lagos,Nigeria.
