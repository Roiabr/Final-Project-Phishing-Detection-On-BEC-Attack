DEAR SIR/MADAM,

THIS IS STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL TO YOU BY THE GRACE OF 
GOD.

I AM JUDE OKORO, THE MANAGER, BILLS AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN
REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF THE WEMA BANK PLC.

I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND COOPERATION TO 
CARRY OUT THIS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN MY DEPARTMENT.

WE DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF $15,000,000.00 (FIFTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO ONE OF OUR 
FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY OF A WIFE AND 
TWO CHILDREN IN NOVEMBER 1997 IN AN ACCIDENT.

SINCE WE HEARD OF HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS NEXT-OF-KIN TO 
COME OVER AND PUT CLAIMS FOR HIS MONEY AS THE HEIR,BECAUSE WE CANNOT 
RELEASE THE FUND FROM HIS ACCOUNT UNLESS SOMEONE APPLIES FOR CLAIM AS 
THE NEXT-OF-KIN TO THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES.

UNFORTUNATELY, NEITHER THEIR FAMILY MEMBER NOR DISTANT RELATIVE HAS 
EVER APPEARED TO CLAIM THE SAID FUND.

MY DEPARTMENT HAVE AGREED TO MAKE BUSINESS WITH YOU AND RELEASE THE 
TOTAL AMOUNT INTO YOUR ACCOUNT AS THE HEIR OF THE FUND SINCE NO ONE 
CAME FOR IT OR DISCOVERED HE MAINTAINED ACCOUNT WITH OUR BANK, 
OTHERWISE THE FUND WILL BE RETURNED TO THE BANKS TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED 
FUND.

WE HAVE AGREED THAT OUR RATIO OF SHARING WILL BE AS STATED THUS; 30% 
FOR YOU AS FOREIGN PARTNER, 60% FOR US THE OFFICIALS IN MY DEPARTMENT 
AND 10% WILL BE AIR-MARKED FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE COURSE 
OF THE BUSINESS.

UPON THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS TRANSFER, I AND ONE OF MY
COLLEAGUES WILL COME TO YOUR COUNTRY AND MIND OUR SHARE. IT IS FROM OUR 
60% WE INTEND TO INVEST IN YOUR COUNTRY AS A WAY OF RECYCLING THE 
FUND.

TO COMMENCE THIS TRANSACTION, WE REQUIRE YOU TO IMMEDIATELY INDICATE 
YOUR INTEREST BY A RETURN E-MAIL AND ENCLOSE YOUR PRIVATE CONTACT 
TELEPHONE NUMBER, FAX NUMBER FULL NAME AND ADDRESS AND YOUR DESIGNATED 
BANK COORDINATES TO ENABLE US FILE LETTER OF CLAIM TO THE APPROPRIATE 
DEPARTMENTS FOR NECESSARY APPROVALS BEFORE THE TRANSFER CAN BE MADE.

NOTE ALSO, THIS TRANSACTION MUST BE KEPT STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BECAUSE 
OF IT'S NATURE.

I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING YOUR PROMPT RESPONSE.

REGARDS,

MR JUDE OKORO,
WEMA BANK PLC,
54,WEMA TOWER BUILDING,
MARINA,LAGOS,
NIGERIA.

NB.
PLEASE REPLY TO <chosenjude1@yahoo.com> WITH YOUR COUNTRY'S DIALLING 
TELEPHONE CODE AND TELEPHONE NUMBER INCLUDED.
