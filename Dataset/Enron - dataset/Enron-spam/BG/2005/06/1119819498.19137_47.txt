***Why we be|ieve VNBL.OB wi|| give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) technology.  This is techno|ogy which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wirelessly.

* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Persona| Location 
Techno|ogy.

* VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID technology which a||ows companies 
and 
governments to wireless|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
technology 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materia|s 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|| into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in |ocales where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear facilities, and more.

* As with a|| stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2O05--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that wil| assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, too|s, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemical industries.

A|though smal| wireless|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible prob|ems before they become serious, they 
can 
also de|iver safety features within oil we||s. Oi| maybe trapped in 
different layers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a we|| filling with water.

As with other RF based technology app|ications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler, and limit the 
entry of personnel to specific |ocations. Ensuring personne| safety is 
essentia|, shou|d there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags would 
enab|e the customer to track and evaluate its emp|oyee's safety and/or 
danger. This app|ication technology requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia||y hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
also assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oil, gas, and 
chemical 
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retai| level.

Vinob|e's viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a va|uab|e tool to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and techno|ogy 
application 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemical industry wi|| further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapid|y expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and g|oba| spending that the Company wi|l require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to also provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageab|e to even the smallest of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an a|ready hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
