NOTIFICATION OF BEQUEST

On behalf of the Trustees and Executors of the estate of Late Engr. Mark 
Halligan, I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter was returned 
undelivered. I hereby attempt to reach you again by this same email address on 
the will. I wish to notify you that late Engr.Mark Halligan made you a 
beneficiary to his will, he left the sum of Nine Million One Hundred Thousand 
Pounds (£9,100.000.00 ) to you in the codicil and last testament to his will. 

This may sound strange and unbelievable to you, but it is real and true. Being 
a widely travelled man, he must have been in contact with you in the past or 
simply you were nominated to him by one of his numerous friends abroad who 
wished you good. Engr.Mark Halligan until his death was a former managing 
director and pioneer staff of a giant construction company(Julius Berger). He 
was a very dedicated Christian who loved to give out. His great philanthropy 
earned him numerous awards during his life time. Late Engr.Mark Halligan died 
in 2004 at the age of 82 years, and his "WILL" is now ready for execution. 

According to him this money is to support your Christian activities and to 
help the poor and the needy. Please If I reach you as I am hopeful, endeavour 
to get back to me as soon as possible by email to enable me conclude my job, 
you should forward along your current telephone number, including your current 
mailing address. I hope to hear from you in no distant time. 

Yours in His service,
 
Smith  Robertson,Esq. (For Trustees) 
Managing Partner(T & West)
