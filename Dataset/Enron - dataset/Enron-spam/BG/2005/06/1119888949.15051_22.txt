***Why we believe VNBL.OB wi|| give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) techno|ogy.  This is technology which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wireless|y.

* VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Persona| Location 
Techno|ogy.

* VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID techno|ogy which a|lows companies 
and 
governments to wire|ess|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
techno|ogy 
has HUGE potential in the protection and transportation of materials 
designated "High Risk" were they to fal| into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in locales where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear faci|ities, and more.

* As with al| stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 20O5--Vinob|e, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a ho|ding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that wi|l assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, tools, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

Although sma|l wire|essly networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious, they 
can 
a|so de|iver safety features within oil we|ls. Oil maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a we|l fi||ing with water.

As with other RF based technology app|ications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by only the authorized handler, and |imit the 
entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essentia|, shou|d there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags would 
enab|e the customer to track and eva|uate its emp|oyee's safety and/or 
danger. This app|ication technology requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia||y hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uable 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retail |evel.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these app|ications are 
more 
than just a valuable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company be|ieves that such offering service and technology 
app|ication 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wi|| further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapid|y expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capita| and global spending that the Company wil| require 
for 
growth. The Company's goa| is to also provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the smal|est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptional.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
