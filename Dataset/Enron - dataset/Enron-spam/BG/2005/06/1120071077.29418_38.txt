Breaking News!!

Pop3 Media Corp. (POPT) and Roxxy Corporation announced that the 
companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby Roxxy Corporation will 
acquire a 66% interest in Pop3's wholly owned subsidiary, Viastar 
Distribution Gr0up, Inc. "VDG," forming a revolutionary new music company, 
Controversial Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting of 
stock and cash, when completed, will provide Pop3's shareholders with a 
33% stake in the new company.

Roxxy's management will operate the company from headquarters in Los 
Angeles and will change its corporate name to Controversial Entertainment 
Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to complete and 
execute the definitive agreement by July 8th, 2005, and seek shareholder 
approval immediately thereafter.

Pop3's CEO, John D. Aquilino, stated, "This alliance will allow Pop3 to 
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music 
industry. One that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they 
create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers 
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media."

Roxxy's management team combines highly experienced industry executives 
drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in-house 
producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry 
today.

"It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major 
labels' lack of commitment to their artists and customers; labels that 
cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi-million 
selling recordings, but who consistently release albums which sell 
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base; artists 
that can easily generate revenues between $1 and $5 milli0n per title," 
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.

"Additionally, the acquisition of VDG will provide us with the ability 
to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22,000 retail 
location in North America, effectively doubling the Company's net 
profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our 
artists."

Mr. Shebanow concluded, "While there are smaller labels that do provide 
a home for these acts, they lack either the will or financial resources 
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have 
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great 
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and the 
customer that Controversial Entertainment will possess."
