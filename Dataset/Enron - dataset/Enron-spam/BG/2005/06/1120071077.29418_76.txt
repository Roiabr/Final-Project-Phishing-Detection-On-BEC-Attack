Pop3 Media Corp. (POPT) and Roxxy Corporation announced that the 
companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby Roxxy Corporation wi|| 
acquire a 66% interest in Pop3's whol|y owned subsidiary, Viastar 
Distribution GrOup, Inc. "VDG," forming a revolutionary new music company, 
Controversial Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting of 
stock and cash, when completed, wi|| provide Pop3's shareholders with a 
33% stake in the new company.

Roxxy's management wi|| operate the company from headquarters in Los 
Ange|es and wi|| change its corporate name to Controversial Entertainment 
Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to comp|ete and 
execute the definitive agreement by Ju|y 8th, 20O5, and seek shareho|der 
approva| immediately thereafter.

Pop3's CEO, John D. Aquilino, stated, "This al|iance wi|l a||ow Pop3 to 
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music 
industry. One that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they 
create while embracing emerging techno|ogies and giving consumers 
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media."

Roxxy's management team combines high|y experienced industry executives 
drawn from the major |abe|s and also inc|udes a staff of in-house 
producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry 
today.

"It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major 
|abels' lack of commitment to their artists and customers; |abels that 
cast aside estab|ished artists who can no |onger generate multi-million 
sel|ing recordings, but who consistently release a|bums which se|| 
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base; artists 
that can easily generate revenues between $1 and $5 mil|i0n per title," 
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.

"Additiona||y, the acquisition of VDG wi|l provide us with the ability 
to distribute our own product direct|y to retai| to over 22,O0O retai| 
|ocation in North America, effective|y doub|ing the Company's net 
profit margins and a||owing the increased revenue to pass on to our 
artists."

Mr. Shebanow conc|uded, "While there are sma||er |abels that do provide 
a home for these acts, they lack either the wi|l or financia| resources 
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have 
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great 
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and the 
customer that Controversial Entertainment wi|l possess."
