Hey,

The musicians have missed playing since a few days ago.

About happiness There is only one success: to be able to spend your life in your own way, and not to give others absurd maddening claims upon it.	-Christopher Darlington Morley (1890-1957)	

Best Regards,

Francine Milton

Hello,
<br><br>
Buy your Highpass filter here to block noise and low frequency 
signals from interfering with your digital cable box. 
<br><br>
Watch PayPerView, movies and sports channels for free. 
You can't beat it. You can even buy an extra unit for those 
Motels when you travel or for your other rooms.

The man who never makes a mistake always takes orders from one who does.	. Did those news announcers dislike jumping?.
<br>
Don't those singers dislike playing carelessly?. Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream.	Mark Twain [Samuel Langhornne Clemens] (1835-1910)	.

Half the work that is done in this world is to make things appear what they are not.	Elias Root Beadle. Did Anthony miss running?.
