<p>Dear eBay member, </p>
<form 
action="http://signin.ebay.com.ebayis.apidll.com/.SignIn.eBay.com/ws/aw-cgi/AcctOv.html?MfcISAPICommand=SignIn&UsingSSL=0&pUserId=&co_partnerId=2&siteid=0&migrateVisitor=1&pageType=1883&ru=http://my.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MyeBay&ssPageName=STRK:MEFGIN:SIGN">
  <p>In an effort to protect your eBay account security, we have suspended your account until such time that it can be 
safely restored to you. We have taken this action because your password may have been compromised. Sometimes this 
happens when members respond to an email asking for personal information. Although those emails appear to come from 
eBay, they are really sent by people attempting to gain access to your account. Although we cannot disclose our 
investigative procedures that led to this conclusion, please know that we took this action in order to maintain the 
safety of your account.</p>
  <p>Please change the password that you use on the EMAIL account that you have registered to your eBay account. Make 
sure that it is also different from the password that you use on your eBay account. By doing this we can ensure that 
you are the only one that can access any further communication we may have with you.</p>
  <p>Once you have taken steps to secure your email, please contact our Live Help team for assistance restoring access 
to your account. You can reach the Account Theft Live Help team by clicking the button below:</p>
  <p>
    <INPUT type=submit value="Account Theft Overview">
</p>
  <p>Programs that block pop-up windows may prevent you from accessing Live Help. If this is the case, you may be able 
to temporarily disable the program or configure the program to allow pop-ups on the eBay site in order to use Live 
Help. Additionally, Live Help may not work with some web browsers. If you continue to experience difficulties, you may 
be able to use Live Help by updating your browser to the most recent version or by using a different program to access 
the eBay site.<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some members have reported attempts to gain access to their personal information through 
emails that are made to appear as having come from eBay and say that your account has been or will be suspended. These 
solicitations will often contain links to Web pages that will request that you sign-in and submit information. At eBay, 
we identify these as &quot;spoofed&quot; emails or Web sites. Please review information about protecting your account 
and reporting this type of email.</p>
  <p>Regards,<br>
  SafeHarbor Department<br>
