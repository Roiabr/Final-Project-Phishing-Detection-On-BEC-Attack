Testimonial from Karen A., in Ohio.  I wanted to say thank you very much
for the information. We appreciate all of the support we have been getting
from you. I have to admit that I was not as convinced as my husband when we
first purchased your program. However, my opinion has certainly changed. The
response from our efforts so far is great, but the help and support we are
getting from you is what has really blown me away. My husband is so excited
(and so am I) that he happened upon this business. He so much wants to get
away from having to travel so much for work and he is determined to be able
to do that within the next 1 to 2 years. I just want to say thank you for
providing that possibility for us.


Presently an elderly gentleman with a reserved and dignified appearance and
dressed in black took a seat next to the boy and drew a magazine from his
pocket. Rob saw that he opened it to an article on The Progress of Modern
Science, in which he seemed greatly interested
After a time the boy remembered that he was hungry, not having eaten a
tablet in more than twenty-four hours
