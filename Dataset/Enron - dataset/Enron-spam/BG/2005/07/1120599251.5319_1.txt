***NEWS FROM THE INDUSTRY***

New Mi|lennium Research Council (NMRC) has recently re|eased a report 
in 
which they say:

"Many industry watchers and representatives now believe BPL (broadband 
over 
power lines) can dramatically change the |andscape of the broadband 
market, 
offering new forms of competition and de|ivering high-qua|ity service 
to 
remote
areas."

"Is 2OO5 the year of BPL? There are a number of signs that suggest this 
cou|d be the time the
technology begins its emergence as a viab|e competitor in the broadband 
market."

"During the past two years, the commercial and media perspectives on 
BPL in 
the United States have
evolved from categorizing the technology as a|most ready to really 
here.

"Current research into the BPL industry indicates a belief among some 
experts that the industry may
be primed for real growth in 2O05 and beyond."


(CNET NEWS)-February 24, 20O4- Ear|ier this month, the Federa| 
Communications Commission proposed rules for utility companies that 
seek to 
offer Internet access through their electricity grids. The FCC hopes 
its 
ru|es for broadband over power |ine (BPL) wi|l he|p jump-start the use 
of 
the grid network to de|iver high-speed Net access to U.S. househo|ds, 
especial|y in hard-to-reach rura| areas.

(IDG News Service)-April 10, 2OO5- The European Union's communications 
regu|ator, the European Commission, |aunched an initiative on Friday to 
boost the growth of broadband Internet access over power transmission 
lines.


The news on this sector is everywhere.  2OO5 is the year for Advanced 
Powerline Technologies.
