Mostly because far too many people we might hate are self-involved sociopaths with large volumes of spare time in which to retaliate. I recently watched a friend of mine stand down from a pointless argument with just such a sociopath. He knew there was no resolution in sight and the agitated party called him a coward. I know my friend is not afraid, but an intelligent man who has no interest in engaging a fruit loop with a penchant for bullying. I wish I knew more cowards like that.4</SPAN></td></tr>
