Dear Sir/Madam,

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business.

I am MR ALBERT WILLIAMS CHIEF AUDITOR MINISTRIE OF FINANCE ECONOMICS COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC.I got your information when I was searching for a reliable,honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact
from the many names and lists in the web site.I wish to transfer the sum of $14,300,000.00 USD (Fourteen Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only.)into your personal or company`s bank account. 

This fund was a residue of the over invoiced Industrial Contract bills awarded by MINISTRIE OF FINANCE ECONOMICS COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC to some foreign firms.This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed off.As the chief auditor,I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary. It was my consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne out of our beleive in  the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-region. 

The original contractors have been duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African States)This balance is suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice.I intend to pay out this fund now as the organisation is winding up its activities. Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise,assistance and partnership in your country. 

It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields wins major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution. 

I have however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40% of the entire sum as compensation,why 55% will be held on trust for me while 5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost if any,during the course of the transactions.This transaction will be successfully concluded within 5-7 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the followings. 

1. Your bank name and address 
2. Your private and confidential telephone 
3. Name to be used as beneficiary 
4. Your bank Telephone and fax number 
5. Or you can within the shortest possible time, confidentially open an entire new (Virgin) account for the transaction. I would prefer this arrangement.

Upon the receipt of this informations,the certificate of job completion of one of the contracts will be issued in your for the transfering of the fund to your nominated account without delay.As with the case of all organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS,we solicit for our unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable business life afterwards. There are no risks involved. 

Well, this is the sharing ratio of this $14.3M for both of us:-

1) I want you to know that my 55% from this fund $14.3M is: $ 7,865,000 :00.
2) While your own 40% from this fund $14.3M is: $5,720,000:00.
3) While 5% from this fund $14.3M for any expenses Made by you and me is: $715,000:00.

REPLY ASAP. 
WITH REGARDS. 
MR ALBERT WILLIAMS(CHIEF AUDITOR).
