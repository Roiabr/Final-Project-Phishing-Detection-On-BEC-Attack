Look for huge news to follow-up last week's blockbuster
Announcement: GEECF Enters Alliance Agreement on 70,000 Barrel

Per Day Oil Refinery. 25 Million Barrels of Oil will be refined 
annually representing cash flow of 1.5 Billion per year.

The former President of OPEC, Humberto Calderon Berti, has come 
on board to run GEECF 100% owned oil division, Sahara Petroleum. 
He is considered the most powerful figure in the international 
oil industry.

Berti has been involved, and is still involved today in the 
exploration and production of the world's largest oil discoveries. 
He is also President and CEO of GEECF's partner, Vetra Oil Group.

Perhaps the most significant factor is the bottom-line dollars 
commanded by Berti for his involvement in oil exploration and 
production projects. You can be assured that each project yields 
a minimum of 10 to 20 Billion annually for Berti to participate.

Look at the pieces of the puzzle coming together. It is clearly 
obvious that the former OPEC President has orchestrated a monster 
of a deal involving an oil-rich property jointly owned by Sahara 
(GEECF) and Vetra Oil. Although no one is talking, in the last 90 
days GEECF brings in Berti, who brings in Vetra Oil (whose clients 
are the world's largest oil super-majors), followed by the entry 
of a developer and refinery. Even though no specific oil deal has 
been disclosed, GEECF just revealed that they will "refine a large 
portion of its own oil at the new refinery."

Fact: Billions in Oil Revenue for GEECF with only 35 million shares 
outstanding could easily translate into 5 or 10 dollars net per 
share earnings, designating GEECF as a hot, mid-tier oil player 
with NYSE qualifications.

If this were the whole story, it would be more than ample reason to 
rate GEECF as our hottest pick of the year. However, in addition, 
there is a GEECF subsidiary dealing in the waste-to-energy sector 
that has secured a 10 Billion, 5-year contract with Chinese 
Government-run companies, including Yanzhou Coal Mining 
(NYSE: YZC, 64) to supply their technology throughout China.

There are no other companies on the OTC that can match-up with GEECF 
and their Multi-Billions in deals on the table. GEECF shares will 
continue to soar and reward aggressive investors. GEECF is on target 
for record-breaking revenues while turning savvy market players into 
millionaires as the value of their oil projects are revealed.
