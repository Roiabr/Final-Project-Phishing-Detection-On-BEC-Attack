Kindly accept my apology for sending my mail to you. I am a true God fearing 
person, and I want you to trust me and help me out in this my condition. I 
believe you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I 
sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country in 
the Internet.

Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile 
political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the 
CNN, BBC news bulletins.

My Name is MRS.SUZANA NUHAN VAYE from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My 
late Husband is Issac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia. 
My Husband was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF 
LIBERIA CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. 
You can verify this from some of the international newspapers posted in the 
web sites below:

Before my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5 million through a 
diplomatic means, and deposited it with a Security Company Abroad. And this 
money was meant for importation of agricultural machinery.

All that is needed is for my lawyer to instruct the company to transfer the 
funds to your account, I will remunerate you with 20% at the end, but most of 
all is that I solicit your trust and honesty in this transaction. I have been 
confined only to our country home and all my calls are monitored, so I will 
advise you to contact my private Attorney Barr.James Broderick base in United 
Kingdom on his contact stated below for onward proceedings: -
