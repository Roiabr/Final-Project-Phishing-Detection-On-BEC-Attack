INTRODUCTION OF MY SELF
As a personal consultant to him, authority was handed over to me in transferring money of an American oil merchant for his last oil deal with my boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Already the funds have left the shore of Russia to a European private bank where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. While I was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his involvement in politics by financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces,led by Boris Nemtsov,and Yabloko,a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian president.You can catch more of the story on the following website:
