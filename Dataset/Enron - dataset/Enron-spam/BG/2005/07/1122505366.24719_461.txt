What is Spyware?

Spyware, like a virus, is a malicious software planted on your PC by a third
party in order to secretly monitor what you do online. 
* Once your browsing habits are analyzed, you are flooded with endless Commercials, 
  Popups and Spam from inside your PC! 
* Spyware also dramatically slows down your computer and Internet connection speeds.
* Spyware collects your private information and steals your identity, passwords, 
  credit card details and other financial data. 
* The presence of the infection is hidden, and is not revealed even by Anti Virus 
  or Firewall programs.
