I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect 

of their conversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; 

But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood a little girl
clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly hair, and eyes so blue
and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them. The child said not a
word, nor did she cry; but each time the little door was opened she gave a
long, long look into the yard. She had not a button- that she knew right
well, and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the
others had seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down, held her
little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl alone
had not seen Puggie's grave. It was a grief as great to her as any grown
person can experience.
