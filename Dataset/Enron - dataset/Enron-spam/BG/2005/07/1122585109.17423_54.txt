There was a huge celebration for him at Minute maid park where there were performers and all kinds of event. While we had a TV crew there I was not.2</SPAN><strong>Can I let you in on a secret? </strong><SPAN style="display:none">Now I want you to think back, to when you were younger. Did you ever wonder what magic your mother had in her, I did once I got older, How is it they were able to ease the pain of a skinned knee just by blowing on it and giving it a little kiss through their hands. It seemed once that was done I can remember the pain virtually just disappearing. They could mend hurt feeling with nothing more then a hug and no matter how dark a day you thought you were having mom always knew what to do or say to brighten it up. Face it mom had a tough job, she had to be the cook, cleaner, Dr. Wife to dad and most important referee all the while working an outside job as well. When you think mom was all soft it would never fail someone or something would threaten her child and she would jump in to the rescue and nothing could stop her. I mean there isn't a force on mother earth that can stop a mom when it comes to her child. 6</SPAN></font></p>
