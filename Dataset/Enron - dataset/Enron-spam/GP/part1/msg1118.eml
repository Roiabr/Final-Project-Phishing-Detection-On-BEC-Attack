I woke up in the hospital, groggy and confused. The last thing I could =
recall was going to bed, how did I get here. I looked up and as the =
blurry face came in to focus I saw my mom standing over me, holding my =
hand, a tear running down her cheek. &quot;Your awake!&quot; She said =
almost surpirsed. &quot;What hapened&quot; I asked barely able to speak. =
&quot;Honey, you were sleep walking again,and you fell and hurt =
yourself.&quot; I tried to sit up, but couldn't move. &quot;Oh,hold =
on&quot; My mom said as she un-did the buckle on a restraint over my =
chest.&quot;You were thrashing around, we had to restrain you so you =
would not get hurt.&quot; I finnaly sat up and stretched my arms. I =
looked over to a mirror and saw the bandages around my head. &quot;Am I =
okay?&quot; i asked worried. &quot;Yes, you'll be fine. You need to stay =
here a little longer, then we can take you home,but we will have to do =
something about your sleepwalking.&quot; I shook my head in agreement, =
but quickly stopped from the sudden pain it caused<BR>
