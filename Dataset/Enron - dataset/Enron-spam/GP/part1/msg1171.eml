<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>FROM: MRS AUDREY MABUZA<BR>
HARARE ZIMBABWE.<BR>
E-MAIL:confitransactn01@yahoo.com<BR>
<BR>
HELLO,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL<BR>
You might be surprised to receive this letter from me since<BR>
you don`t know me personally. I am Mrs.AUDRY MABUZA the<BR>
wife of late Mr WILLIEM MABUZA who was murdered by the<BR>
Zimbabwean war veterans and irate black people. I am<BR>
writing this letter from Harare, Zimbabwe, to solicit for<BR>
your special assistance to my family shattered by a<BR>
tyrannical government led by a dictator and his (ZANU-PF)<BR>
ruling party, President ROBERT MUGABE.<BR>
<BR>
Because of land and farmland crisis in Zimbabwe the<BR>
government secretly sponsored the war veterans and some<BR>
irate party members to disposed the land being occupied by<BR>
the white farmers. This action led to killing of some<BR>
members of opposition party including my husband who did<BR>
not support this ill-fated action. But before the death of<BR>
my husband, he anticipated some dangers and so he smuggled<BR>
out the sum of US$25.5 million dollars (Twenty five<BR>
million, five Hundred Thousand united state dollars) to<BR>
South Africa and deposited it in a Security Company with<BR>
the intention of using it for the purchase of farm<BR>
machinery and chemicals for agricultural Purpose in South<BR>
Africa and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland.<BR>
<BR>
This money was deposited in a box as family valuables to<BR>
avoid much demurrage in the Security Company. On the 29<BR>
January 2003 the war&nbsp; veterans and some supporters of<BR>
(ZANU-PF) ruling party trooped into our compound and axed<BR>
my husband to death and my second son of 28yrs. Since then<BR>
they have been terrorizing my son VUYO but he managed to<BR>
escape to neighbouring country South Africa as a political<BR>
asylum seeker (refugee).<BR>
<BR>
His position in South Africa does not permit him to open an<BR>
account or to operate any business. That is why I want this<BR>
fund to be transferred in your account so that you will<BR>
assist him to invest the money in your country. If you<BR>
accept to assist us, all I want from you is to arrange and<BR>
come down to Johannesburg South Africa so that you can help<BR>
him to open a non-resident bank account in your name which<BR>
will aid us in transferring the money into your nominating<BR>
account overseas.<BR>
<BR>
I have two options for you, firstly, you can choose to have<BR>
certain percentage of the money for nominating your account<BR>
in this transaction or we can go into partnership with you<BR>
for the proper profitable investment of the money in your<BR>
country whichever the option you want feel free to notify<BR>
him. He will then furnish you with every detail you need to<BR>
know.<BR>
<BR>
We have also mapped out 5% of the total sum for any<BR>
expenses that might be incurred during the time of this<BR>
transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership, we are<BR>
willing to give you 25% of the money while the remaining<BR>
70% will remain for my family, if you are really capable<BR>
and willing to assist us please contact him immediately in<BR>
South Africa with this telephone +27-84-765-9131, or e-mail<BR>
address confitransactn01@yahoo.com<BR>
<BR>
Finally please treat this matter as urgent as possible.<BR>
Thanks for you?re mutual co-operation. I`m expecting your<BR>
soonest and urgent response.<BR>
<BR>
Best Regards,<BR>
<BR>
MRS AUDREY MABUZA.<BR>
