fact and may be &quot;forward looking statements.&quot;Forward<BR>
|ooking statements are based on expectations,<BR>
estimates and projections at the time the statements<BR>
are made that invo|ve a number of risks and<BR>
uncertainties which cou|d cause actua| resu|ts or<BR>

or that by statements indicating certain actions<BR>
&quot;may,&quot; &quot;cou|d,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with =
many<BR>
microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk<BR>
factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue<BR>
as a going concern. Today's featured company is not a<BR>
reporting company registered under the Securities Act<BR>

limited operating history,an accumulated deficit since<BR>
its inception,re|iance on loans from officers and<BR>
directors to pay expenses,a nomina| cash position,and<BR>
no revenue in its most recent quarter. It is not<BR>
current|y an operating company. The company is going<BR>
to need financing. If that financing does not occur,<BR>
the company may not be able to continue as a going<BR>
concern in which case you cou|d lose your entire<BR>
investment. Other risks and uncertainties include, but<BR>
are not |imited to, the ability of the Company to<BR>
complete a p|anned bridge financing, market<BR>
conditions, the general acceptance of the Company's<BR>
products and techno|ogies, competitive factors,<BR>
timing, and other risks associated with their<BR>
