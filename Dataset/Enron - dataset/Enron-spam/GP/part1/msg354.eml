<p> Two people can look at the exact same thing and see something =
totally different.    Sign on a church bulletin board: <br>
  To realize the value of ONE SECOND<br>
   Success: its an never ending improvement in what you do.   At least I =
think that's what she said."   <br>
   A closed mind is like a closed book; just a block of wood. (Chinese =
proverb)  <br>
   7/5th of all people do not understand fractions.    Silence is =
golden, and example is the best teacher, so is a silent example a golden =
teacher,   Two rules to success in life: 1. Don't tell people everything =
you know.  <br>
   To be or not to be... I think its a trick question.    A compliment =
is a statement of an agreeable truth; flattery is the statement of an =
agreeable untruth. (Sir John A. MacDonald)   To realize the value of ONE =
HOUR<br>
   Church is the only place I know, where I can arrive late and get the =
best seats in the house!    Reputation is made in a moment: character is =
built in a lifetime.    Two things are sure in life: There is a God, and =
you are not him.  <br>
   There are 10 types of people in the country, those who understand =
binary and those who don't.    Confrontation doesn't always bring a =
solution to the problem, but until you confront the problem, there will =
be no solution. (James Baldwin)    Quotations are sometimes valuable =
pearls, but original thoughts can be priceless treasure. =20
