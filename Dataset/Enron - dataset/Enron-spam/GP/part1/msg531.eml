GILFORD, N.H., 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- iStorage =
Networks, Inc. (Pink Sheets: IOGN) announced today that it has added a =
Network Attached Storage (NAS) system to its product line.<BR>
<BR>
NAS is digital storage that is set up with its own network address =
rather than being attached to the department computer which provides the =
applications to network's workstation users. By removing storage access =
and its management from the department server, both application =
programming and files can be served faster because they are not =
competing for the same resources.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Kirkland, VP Sales and Marketing, stated, &quot;In response to our =
customers needs, iStorage will begin offering a NAS product to =
compliment it iSCSI and Direct Attached Storage (DAS) systems. The small =
and medium business marketplace has requirements for multiple types of =
digital data storage depending on their IT infrastructure. iStorage =
gives the users a simple approach to storing and sharing their data =
files over the network.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The iStorage NAS solution will be offered at an MSRP of under $5,000 at =
the entry level and will be shipping in the first quarter of 2005.<BR>
