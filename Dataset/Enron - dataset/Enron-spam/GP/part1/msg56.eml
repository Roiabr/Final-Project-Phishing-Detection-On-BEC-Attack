COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON<BR>
<BR>
Good&nbsp; Day!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I&nbsp; am the manager of bills and exchange&nbsp; at the foriegn =
remittance department of the (ABN AMRO BANK AMSTERDAM ). I am writting =
you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out =
this transaction. We discovered some abandoned sum $15,500,000(FIFTEEN =
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLAR ) in an account that belongs =
to one of our foriegn customer who died along-side his entire family in =
march this year in a terrorist train bomb blast in Spain some few months =
ago.Since this development,we have advertised for his next of kin or any =
close relation to come forward to claim this money,but nobody came yet =
to apply for the claim.<BR>
<BR>
To this effect,i and other&nbsp; official in my department have decided =
to look for a trusted foriegn partner who can stand in as the next =
of&nbsp; kin of the deceased as we cannot do it only ourselves and =
claim&nbsp; this money.We need a foreign partner to apply for the claim =
on our behalf because of the fact that the customer was a foreign and we =
don't want this money to go into the treasury as unclaimed fund.<BR>
<BR>
Every document to effect this process will emanate from my table and i =
will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and =
guideline,so you have nothing to worry about and we have agreed that 30% =
of this money will be for you,while 10%will be for any expenses incured =
on both sides wihile 60% will be for my colleagues and me.<BR>
If you are willing to help us,please indicate by replying this letter =
and putting in your name, private telephone number,fax and permanent =
residential address via my private email address below.I awaits your =
immediate response to enable us start this transaction as soon as i =
recieved your reply,i will send you a text application form for =
immediate APPLICATIION OF CLAIM.<BR>
<BR>
Please contact me even if you are not intrested in my proposal to you to =
enable us scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your =
part.<BR>
Thanks for your co-operation<BR>
