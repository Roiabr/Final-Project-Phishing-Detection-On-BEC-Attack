Hi Varou,=20
<p>
When you hide your anxious feelings for months or years, you perpetuate =
your anxiety by assuming it's your fault. Anxiety is not your fault. =
There is nothing inherently wrong with who you are. You are a good, =
valuable, uniquely special person. You simply suffer from anxiety.=20
<p>
Our online store is the place to find many prescription drugs without a =
prior prescription.
<p>
We don't require any prescriptions.. <a =

<p>
Best regards,=20
