<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Goodday to you.<BR>
Dear friend. You may be surprised to received this letter from me<BR>
because<BR>
you dont know me in person , I am Dr mabo dagash, the first and only<BR>
son<BR>
of late Mr Mallam Dagash, who was murdered in the land dispute in<BR>
Zimbabwe,I<BR>
was furnished of your profile from your country web site I decided =
to<BR>
contact<BR>
you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to HOLLAND to<BR>
deposit<BR>
the sum of US$25,000,000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION US DOLLAR), in a =
private<BR>
security<BR>
and Finance company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in =
Zimbabwe.<BR>
This<BR>
amount was meant for the purchase of chemicals and<BR>
tractors for the development of our new farms in Swaziland. This =
land<BR>
problem<BR>
came<BR>
when the Zimbabwean President Mr ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new land<BR>
reform act, which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some =
black<BR>
farmers.<BR>
This result to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and<BR>
some<BR>
lunatics in the society, Alot of people have been killed because of<BR>
this<BR>
land-reform act, which my father is one of them. You can look up to =
CNN<BR>
news every day for what ism happening in the country,if you are in<BR>
doubt,<BR>
you can also go to the internet to see:<BR>

it is against this backdrop that my family and I who are currently =
in<BR>
Zimbabwe<BR>
decided to transfer our fathers money to any foreign account since =
the<BR>
Zimbabwe<BR>
law prohibits refugees(asylum seekers) to operate any type of bank<BR>
account<BR>
or to be involved in any huge financial transaction. As the eldest<BR>
child<BR>
of my father, I am seeking for a genuine foreign partner who can =
help<BR>
us<BR>
transfer this money in to his or her oversea<BR>
account. On the other hand,the Zimbabwe government seems to be =
playing<BR>
along<BR>
with<BR>
them. We are therefore faced with the dilemma of investing this =
money<BR>
in<BR>
Zimbabwe for the fear of going through the same experience in =
future,<BR>
As<BR>
a business man whom I willentrust my future and that of my entire<BR>
family<BR>
in his or her hands,I must let you know that this business is<BR>
completely<BR>
100% risk-free. As we cannot accept to venture into<BR>
any dangerous deal with our fortune, if you therefore accept to =
assist<BR>
us,<BR>
which I know that you will. Please I will like you to contact me<BR>
urgently.<BR>
Feel free to ask all questions<BR>
you deem necessary. For your assistance , we have proposed two =
options<BR>
for<BR>
you.<BR>
(1)You may go into partnership with me for the proper profitable<BR>
investment<BR>
of the money in your country. (2)If you do not prefer a partnership, =
I<BR>
am<BR>
illing to give you 25% of the sum while the remaining 70% will be =
for<BR>
my<BR>
family prior for investment in your country, while the remaining 5%<BR>
will<BR>
be used to defray all the expenses that may incure during the =
process<BR>
of<BR>
this transaction. You are therefore required of absolute<BR>
confidentiality<BR>
of this matter.<BR>
you can reply me in my private mail box:mabodagash100@netscape.net<BR>
God bless you.<BR>
Yours truly,<BR>
