<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Friend,<BR>
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have =
not yet met.&nbsp; I have to say that I have no intentions of causing =
you any pains so i decided to contact you through this medium .As =
you&nbsp; read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I =
believe everyone&nbsp;&nbsp; will die someday.<BR>
My name is&nbsp; Shehu Abdul, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have =
been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered =
very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all =
form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live =
according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so =
well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my =
business.<BR>
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to =
people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared =
for. But now I regret all this as I now know&nbsp; that&nbsp; there is =
more to life than just wanting to&nbsp;&nbsp; have or make all the money =
in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to =
this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived =
it. Now that I know my&nbsp;&nbsp; time is near, I have willed and given =
most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family =
members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I =
have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be =
one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed =
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, London and Ireland. =
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self =
any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts =
and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in =
Bulgaria; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not =
trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have =
left for them. The last of my money which is the&nbsp;&nbsp; huge cash =
deposit that I have with Financial Firm Abroad .I will want you to help =
me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and =
let&nbsp; them know that it is I Shehu Abdul that is making this =
generous donation.<BR>
I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed where I =
wait for my time to come. I pray that God uses you to support and assist =
me with good heart<BR>
<BR>
God be with you(Masallam).<BR>
Shehu Abdul<BR>

NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until =
the task is accomplished as I don=12t want anything that will jeopardize =
my last wish. and Also I<BR>
will be contacting with you by email as I don=12t want anybody to know =
because they are always around me.<BR>
