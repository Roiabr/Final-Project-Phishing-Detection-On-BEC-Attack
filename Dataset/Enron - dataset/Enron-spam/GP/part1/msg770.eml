<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>MR MAKOSANA PHILIP<BR>
philmakosana@netscape.net<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STRICTLY =
CONFIDENTIAL.<BR>
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me<BR>
since you don't know me personally.I am Mr philip<BR>
Makosana, the first son of Late Joseph Makosana, who<BR>
was murdered in a land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your<BR>
contact through an internet trade directory here in<BR>
Italy and I decided to contact you. I do not know your<BR>
person but I relied on faith to see me through.<BR>
Black war veterans claiming to be farmers, invaded my<BR>
father?s house on April 16, 2000 at about 6.32am in<BR>
Macheke/Virginia district and murdered my father<BR>
because of his insistence that white farmers be<BR>
allowed to retain their farm lands despite the<BR>
recently introduced land reforms Act, in Zimbabwe by<BR>
the head of state, Sir Robert Mugabe. Until his death<BR>
he was the vice president of the Zimbabwean Farmers<BR>
Union (ZFU). It took us so long to contact you because<BR>
we had to wait for the appropriate time to do so. (The<BR>
reason I will explain to you in details later on.)<BR>
Before his untimely death, he had deposited the sum of<BR>
Nineteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$<BR>
19,500,000.00) This money was deposited in a box as<BR>
family valuables to avoid demurrage from the security<BR>
company. This fund was meant for the purchase of new<BR>
machinery and agro-allied chemicals for the new farms<BR>
acquired in Swaziland.<BR>
This land problem came when our President, Sir Robert<BR>
Mugabe introduced a new land act, Modus Operandi<BR>
reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers. A<BR>
lot of people were killed because of this land reforms<BR>
Act of which my late father was one of the main<BR>
targets. My father was solely targeted because of his<BR>
support for the white farmers.<BR>
Based on this, my family had to spread out; I am now<BR>
in Italy with my brother as refugees while my mother<BR>
and my younger sister are living in South Africa as<BR>
refugees as well. We decided to contact you to assist<BR>
us in transferring this money to your account in your<BR>
country or any part of the world for investment as the<BR>
monetary/investment laws of South Africa and Italy<BR>
prohibits refugees from running bank accounts or be<BR>
involved in any transaction/investment. Based on this,<BR>
we contacted you hoping that you will assist us with<BR>
this transaction in the name of God.<BR>
As the only educated son, I am saddled with the<BR>
responsibility of seeking a genuine and an honest<BR>
person who will assist us in transferring this money<BR>
out of South Africa without the knowledge of my<BR>
country(Zimbabwe) government who are bent on taking<BR>
everything my late father had after confiscating all<BR>
his farmlands and investments in Zimbabwe and<BR>
Swaziland. We are absolutely left with nothing except<BR>
the money I talked about previously.<BR>
For your kind assistance, my mother and I,are offering<BR>
you 20% of the funds after the successful transfer of<BR>
the funds to your account .5% will be set aside for<BR>
any expenses that might result in the process of this<BR>
transaction, while 75% will be for my family which<BR>
will be used for investment in your country under your<BR>
direction as we do not know anything about<BR>
investments.<BR>
Please contact me through the&nbsp; e-mail<BR>
address indicated above if this proposal is of<BR>
interest to you because,I need your entire support and<BR>
co-operation for the success of this transaction.If<BR>
not then, I humbly apologise for this infringement on<BR>
your privacy.<BR>
Yours truly,<BR>
Philip Makosana.&nbsp; </FONT>
