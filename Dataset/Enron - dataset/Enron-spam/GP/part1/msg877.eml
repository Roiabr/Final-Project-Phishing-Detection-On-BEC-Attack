<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Pardon the abruptness and the liberty of this<BR>
letter; It is due to its exigency.<BR>
<BR>
I am a Bank official in the UK. I write to ask for your help.<BR>
I am in need of a foreign partner to assist in the transfer of a<BR>
considerable amount of money.<BR>
What we require is someone who is reliable and trustworthy, who has a =
vision<BR>
and who will be able to manage whatever business in which we shall =
inject<BR>
venture capital. We need someone who can share our dreams and =
ideals.<BR>
<BR>
I have the legal title to the sum and we shall go through the legal<BR>
procedures entailed in both our laws and international laws in =
transferring<BR>
the funds to you in trust.<BR>
Please do not at this point misunderstand my intention, because<BR>
understandably, we are not acqainted. I do not even know if you will =
be<BR>
reliable and trustworthy, but I believe that everything starts with a =
first<BR>
step. I know that I need to explain everything clearly to you before you =
can<BR>
come to a decision as to whether you can assist me or not, and I will =
do<BR>
this as soon as I get a response from you.<BR>
<BR>
I am sure that with the insider information I can provide, we will with =
your<BR>
help, conclude the transaction within 7 working days. In consideration =
for<BR>
your assistance, we have agreed to give you the normal transaction<BR>
commission obtainable of 10% of the total sum, and another 5% if you =
can<BR>
successfully put together an investment portfolio for us, as we will =
like to<BR>
invest some of this money in your country, rather than leave it idle in =
a<BR>
bank account.<BR>
<BR>
If you can be of assistance, please write to me for more =
information,<BR>
otherwise, I thank you for your patience.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your courtesies.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
Peter Jackson<BR>
