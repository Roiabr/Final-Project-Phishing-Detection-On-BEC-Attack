<BR>
Content distribution is presently not anymore limited to music and is =
becoming more<BR>
cross media oriented. New distribution models for old and new content =
formats are<BR>
opening new paths: i-TV, mobile phones, PDAs, etc. The development of =
the Internet<BR>
technologies introduces strong impact on system architectures and =
business processes. New national and international regulations, policies =
and market evolution are<BR>
constraining the distribution mechanisms. Novel distribution models, =
development<BR>
and application of pervasive computing and multimedia strongly influence =
this multi-<BR>
disciplinary field. The need of content control and monitoring is =
demanding effective<BR>
Digital Rights Management (DRM) solutions integrated with sustainable =
business and<BR>
transaction models. These technologies impact on the production and =
modelling of<BR>
cross media content.<BR>
<BR>
WEDELMUSIC-2004 aims to explore these major topics in cross media field, =
to address<BR>
novel approaches for distributing content to larger audiences, providing =
wider access<BR>
&nbsp;and encouraging broader participation. The impact of these =
developments on cultural<BR>
heritage is also considered, together with their availability to people =
with limited access to content.<BR>
<BR>
The conference is open to all the enabling technologies behind these =
problems. We<BR>
are promoting discussion and interaction among researchers, =
practitioners, developers,<BR>
final users, technology transfer experts, and project managers.<BR>
<BR>
Topics<BR>
<BR>
Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:<BR>
<BR>
--Protection formats and tools for music<BR>
--Transaction models for delivering music, Business models for =
publishers<BR>
--Copyright ownership protection<BR>
--Digital Rights Management<BR>
--High quality Audio Coding<BR>
--Watermarking techniques for various media types<BR>
--Formats and models for distribution<BR>
--Music manipulation and analysis, transcoding, etc..<BR>
--Music and tools for impaired people - Braille<BR>
--Publishers and distributors servers<BR>
--Cross media delivery on multi-channel systems, mobile, i-TV, PDAs, =
Internet, etc.<BR>
--Automatic cross media content production<BR>
--MPEG-4, MPEG-7 and MPEG-21<BR>
--Viewing and listening tools for music<BR>
--Music editing and manipulation<BR>
--Music education techniques<BR>
--Content based retrieval<BR>
--Conversion and digital adaptation aspects, techniques and tools<BR>
--Music imaging, music sheet digitalisation,<BR>
--Solutions for cultural heritage valorisation<BR>
<BR>
see for other topics the web site.<BR>
<BR>
Research Papers<BR>
<BR>
Papers should describe original and significant work in the research and =
practice<BR>
of the main topics listed above. Research case studies, applications and =
experiments<BR>
are particularly welcome. Papers should be limited to approx. 2000-5000 =
words<BR>

<BR>
The Open Workshop of MUSICNETWORK is at its third edition. The modeling =
ofmusic<BR>
notation/representation is a complex problem. Music representation can =
be used<BR>
for several different purposes: entertainment, music education, =
infotainment,<BR>
music archiving and retrieval, music querying, music production, music =
profiling,<BR>
&nbsp;etc. In the current Internet and Multimedia age many other =
applications are<BR>
strongly getting the market attention and most of them will become more =
diffuse<BR>
of the present applications in short time. End users have discovered the =
multimedia<BR>
experience, and thus, the traditional music models are going to be =
replaced by<BR>
their integration with multimedia, audio visual, cross media. At =
present, there is<BR>
&nbsp;a lack of Music Notation/Representation standard integrated with =
multimedia. The<BR>
aim of this workshop is to make a further step to arrive at =
standardizing a Music<BR>
Notation/Representation Model and Decoder integrated into the MPEG =
environment,<BR>
that presently can be regarded as the most active and powerful set of =
standard<BR>
formats for multimedia consumers.<BR>
<BR>
The topics of the workshop are related mainly focused on:<BR>
<BR>
--Music Notation/Representation requirements<BR>
--Music Protection and Distribution<BR>
--Music Description and its usage on Archive Query<BR>
<BR>
Please Contribute with your work on the above topics, for details see =
the www site<BR>
of the workshop.<BR>

The access is be free of charge, supported by the European =
Commission.<BR>
