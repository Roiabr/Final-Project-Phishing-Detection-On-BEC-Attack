IKOYI.<BR>
EMAIL :t_mana@fsmail.net<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly =
through my proposal as contained in this letter.Before going<BR>
into details of my proposal to you, I must first solicit you to treat =
this with utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its<BR>
success.<BR>
<BR>
INTRODUCTION:<BR>
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of =
Nigeria? Contracts Review Panel who are interested in<BR>
investing some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the =
Central Bank of Nigeria. In order to commence this<BR>
transaction, we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your =
account the said floating funds.<BR>
<BR>
We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this =
quarter of 2003. The source of the funds are as follows: During<BR>
the last military regime,government officials awarded contracts that =
were grossly over-invoiced to Contractors.The present civilian<BR>
government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to =
use the instruments of payments made available to it by the<BR>
decree setting up<BR>
the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are =
being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have<BR>
identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating =
in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and<BR>
would like to invest some of it for our own purposes.<BR>
<BR>
However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of =
this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the<BR>
names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been =
mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to<BR>
look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer =
the sum of Sixteen million,five hundred thousand U.S.<BR>
Dollars That is why I am writing you this letter.<BR>
<BR>
We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,if =
you agree with our proposition as follows; (i) 10% to the<BR>
account owner (you). (ii) 80% for us (the panel officials). (iii) 10% to =
be used in settling all expenses (by both you and<BR>
us )incidental to the actualisation of this project. We wish to invest =
our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock<BR>
markets and other business till we are<BR>
ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here =
at home.<BR>
<BR>
Please note that this transaction is 100% safe . We intend to effect the =
transfer within fourteen(14) banking days from the date of<BR>
receipt of the following information: Your name, company? name, address =
,telephone and fax numbers . The above information will<BR>
enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. This =
way, we will use your company? name to apply for the<BR>
payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are =
looking forward to carrying out this transaction with you and<BR>
we solicit your utmost confidentiality in its execution.<BR>
<BR>
Please acknowledge the receipt of this email by replying urgently. =
Also,endeavour to furnish me with your phone number so that I can<BR>
call you and bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction =
when I hear from you.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
<BR>
Dr Tukur Mana.<BR>
