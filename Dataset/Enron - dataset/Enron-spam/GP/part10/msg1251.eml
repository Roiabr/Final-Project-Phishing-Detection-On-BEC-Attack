Market Watch News Flash<BR>
<BR>
Explosive short term trading profits in a new technology<BR>
issue (Ticker: SRGE) are being predicted as many<BR>
significant news releases indicate strong contractual<BR>
revenues with major Telecom firms.<BR>
<BR>
SRGE has been successfully working with Telecommunications<BR>
giants (with five million subscriber lines) over the last 4<BR>
years, but is now projecting &quot;a banner expansion year with<BR>
geometric growth in revenues&quot; due largely to sales demands<BR>
for their innovative patented products and expansion into<BR>
International telecom markets.<BR>
<BR>
Surge Technologies, Inc. (SRGE) is a cutting-edge leader<BR>
that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets superior<BR>
patented outside plant electrical surge protection<BR>
equipment for the telecommunications industry.<BR>
The US sales projections for this market are $4 Billion<BR>
annually, with this figure growing rapidly as the<BR>
expansion of new HDSL and ADSL technologies permeate<BR>
the industry.<BR>
<BR>
SRGE provides the Telecom industry with the highest<BR>
quality &quot;protection element&quot; for complex digital switches.<BR>
Protecting these Telecom switching devices is crucial to<BR>
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions<BR>
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage, thus<BR>
negating costly and time-consuming repair and down-time.<BR>
Major Telecoms require this protection throughout their<BR>
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming<BR>
personnel, damaging expensive equipment, and massive<BR>
system failures.<BR>
<BR>
Opening Price: 1.15<BR>
10 Day Target: 2.30<BR>
1 Month Target: 4.50<BR>
Outstanding Shares: 16.5 million<BR>
Est. Float: 2.2 million<BR>
<BR>
How many times have you seen issues explode but you<BR>
couldn't get your hands on them or didn't have the right<BR>
information in time? We are alerting you now to a special<BR>
Company with a unique technology that is on the forefront<BR>
of a breakout! We are excited about SRGE's technology<BR>
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with<BR>
Major US Telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases<BR>
in revenue for 2004 and 2005. SRGE has made phenomenal<BR>
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in<BR>
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued,<BR>
therefore a 300%-400% jump may wind up being conservative.<BR>
