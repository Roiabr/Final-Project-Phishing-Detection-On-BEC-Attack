<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Friend.<BR>
Good Day, With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I =
hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising =
this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any =
dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of =
its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on =
your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, for I make this =
proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to =
introduce myself properly to you. I am Mr Patrick F.Massaquoi the son of =
late Liberia sport minister Mr Francois Massaquoi,who was killed while =
in office in 2001.<BR>
<BR>
After these event, the Charles Taylor control government provided the =
family with security. But presently the united nations and the united =
state government, asked the liberia head of state (Charles Taylor) and =
members of his cabinet to go on exile. During the tenure of Late =
Francois Massaquoi,(my father) he enriched and accumulated a lot of =
money while in office but unfortunately for him he did not leave long to =
enjoy these wealth.<BR>
<BR>
These funds were lodged in different banks accounts in Europe and =
America. However, my family is not too comfortable with any in coming =
government as my late father was a very close aide of Charles Taylor, =
and on this backdrop any succeded government might decided to froze all =
of these accounts and recall the money back to liberia, with exception =
of the US$8.5M(Eight million,five hundred United State Dollars)that was =
deposited in a security company undiscovered uptil date. But due to the =
sanction place on my family by the International community i cannot =
reach this money myself or withdraw it to Liberia for use.<BR>
<BR>
We have jointly decided within the family to relocate this funds outside =
Liberia for investment. This is the only ways and means we can utilize =
this money, consequently, we beg for your assistance in investing this =
money on real-estate and any other viable venture you might suggest. I =
got your contact through the internet during my search for a partner and =
i hope you will not disapoint us. We have also agreed to reward you with =
25% of the total amount as your share in this transaction after you =
might have claim this funds from the security company.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, i require the following informations to facilitate and =
normalize the documentation with the security company.<BR>
&nbsp; (a) Your complete names.<BR>
&nbsp; (b) Your mailing address and nationality,<BR>
&nbsp; (c) Your Telephone/Fax numbers.<BR>
Again, all arrangement and logistics of this transaction are in place =
and we shall remain greatful if you can assist us in this our time of =
need.<BR>
<BR>
Please contact me with my confidential email address whether or not you =
are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another =
partner in the event of non-interest on your part, to know more about my =
late father you can visit the following website;<BR>
