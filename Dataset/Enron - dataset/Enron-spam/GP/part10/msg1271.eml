<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir,<BR>
<BR>
I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as =
we are using the<BR>
only secured and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign =
assistance in a business.<BR>
It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and<BR>
assistance in the context stated below:May I first introduce my self: I =
am<BR>
Dr.(Mrs.) MARIAM ABACHA,the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former<BR>
Military head of state and President of the Federal Republic of =
Nigeria)<BR>
who died suddenly on 8th June 1998. I got your contact on the internet =
as<BR>
I was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life =
and my children,<BR>
hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my =
husband.<BR>
I have lost confidence with anybody within the country.<BR>
<BR>
Having noted the confidence reposed on your person,<BR>
I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in =
receiving<BR>
the sum of US$20 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late =
general<BR>
(my husband).<BR>
<BR>
This money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I =
have<BR>
all documents with me as of when it was deposited&nbsp; in a Security =
Vault for<BR>
safe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also =
to<BR>
avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.<BR>
it is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my<BR>
organisation &quot;FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM&quot; (F.S.P). I will =
enlighten you more of this<BR>
organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on =
my behalf.<BR>
On your acceptance to render this assistance to me<BR>
to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to =
a<BR>
conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for<BR>
non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current =
civilian<BR>
administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of =
the<BR>
Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the Abacha =
family<BR>
because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late<BR>
husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta,the present =
Government have<BR>
resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including<BR>
properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize =
the<BR>
various bank accounts of my husband in Swizerland,UK,Australia. In =
fact,<BR>
the attack on our family (The Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent =
of<BR>
seizing our travelling passport,family accounts and even trying some =
members of our<BR>
family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband.<BR>
<BR>
In view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal =
survival,our<BR>
family trustee have secretly protected the will,The Security Company =
has<BR>
called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of =
the<BR>
demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it =
very<BR>
soon. but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an =
overseas<BR>
amount, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will =
come<BR>
to my full assistance and unlimited<BR>
co-operation.In the meantime,there is a travelling embargo on us(the =
whole<BR>
family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently =
living<BR>
on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for =
the<BR>
sins<BR>
of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be =
trustworthy<BR>
and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my<BR>
children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will<BR>
compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% =
of<BR>
the total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.<BR>
In that case, when the money ($20 Million) is moved into your<BR>
discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in<BR>
your favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might =
incur<BR>
(There are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed =
by<BR>
you.)during the process of securing this consignment. The remaining 65% =
will be invested meaningfully for my<BR>
children's future. My cousin (Dr.yemi musa) has perfected arrangements =
with<BR>
the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and =
safe<BR>
operation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the =
Finance<BR>
Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the =
bona-fide<BR>
owner.And in due course, all contacts must be made through<BR>
Dr yemi musa&nbsp; through this E-mail: address&nbsp;&nbsp; =
yemimusa2@hotvoice.com&nbsp; and<BR>
phone:00221 512 48 59. Senegal.<BR>
<BR>
I look forward to your quick response while thanking<BR>
you for your co-operation. In view of all above<BR>
details, I request you to keep this letter and<BR>
co-operation highly confidential.<BR>
<BR>
