copper.
After studying these pieces for a long time, Germany announced that the
ancient Germans 25,000 years ago had a nation-wide telephone net. =
Naturally,
the Russian government was not that easily impressed. They ordered their =

glass and they soon announced that the ancient Russians 35,000 years ago
already had a nation-wide fiber net. American scientists were outraged =
