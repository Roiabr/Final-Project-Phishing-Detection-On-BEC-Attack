             <p>International Telephone Services (ITS) is a =
telecommunications company born in 1995 and whose objective was to bring =
the most advanced technology in communications within the reach of its =
clients.</p>

<p>ITS started off offering a call-back service to a wide portfolio of =
foreigners on the Costa del Sol (south of Spain), then extending this to =
businesses also based in the area.</p>

<p>As of December 1998, when full liberalisation occurred in the =
telecommunications market in Spain, ITS focused its efforts on providing =
a made-to-measure service to each client at the best price and with a =
high level of quality. The company at this point offered primarily long =
distance national and international calls, prepaid calling cards, and =
intelligent numbers (90X, 800-type).</p>

<p>With the boom in the Telecoms markets up to mid 2000, ITS began to =
quote on the OTCBB and began expanding its presence to other prime =
tourist locations in Spain. Unfortunately, the initiative did not have =
enough time to get traction before the dot.com bubble burst and with it =
dragged investor confidence in the rest of the telecommunications =
sector. By the end of 2001, ITS downsized its operations and refocused =
its efforts on the south of Spain in order to "ride out the storm."</p>

<p>By January 2002, actual shareholders, not happy with the financial or =
business results produced by the management at the time, and in the =
absence of a clear strategy to bring ITS back to the forefront of the =
competitive telecoms market in Spain, decided to change the management =
team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of =
relaunching ITS as a serious contender and thereby increasing company =
value. </p>

<p>As of the end of March, ITS' new CEO joined the company bringing with =
him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in Spain and =
North America.</p>

<p>Since this time, the new CEO has put in place a new executive team =
consisting of a new CFO and COO as well as Director of Sales. These key =
positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and =
consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related =
work experience to the project.</p>

<p>In addition, the focus of the company is being changed from being a =
regionally focused reseller of services to an Integrated =
Telecommunications Provider focused on the competitive packaging of =
services to specific market segments nationwide. Some of these services =
will be resold and others will be developed by ITS, installed, =
maintained and supported by ITS, thus providing a differentiated =
advantage with respect to its traditional competitors. Some of these =
services will be innovative services not yet offered in Spain. Another =
element to maximize the effectiveness of this new positioning is that =
the head office has been moved to Madrid, Spain's Telecoms center.</p>

<p>The new ITS is positioning is focused on ensuring that every dollar =
of capital employed has a satisfactory return from ITS shareholders. As =
such, ITS is:</p>

<p>
1) Building very little "owned" infrastructure for commodity services, =
utilizing and integrating the vast amount of underutilized =
infrastructure of other existing operators.<br>

2) Investing in technologically innovative infrastructures and =
services.<br>

3) Investing in optimising its Commercial Dimensions.</p>


<p>The company has an excellent list of blue chip distribution partners, =
such as: Corte Ingles, Respol (petrol stations) and Carrefour (220 =
stores).</p>

<p>The cards are distributed at over 2000 outlets in Spain, including =
1,000 post offices.</p>

<p>The company has pending contracts with a U.S. Military Base in Spain, =
15 adventure and Marine parks, and a large chain of convenience stores =
throughout Spain.</p>
