<p>Further to Our Press Release of March 2nd, 2004 ' ... Wind is the =
World's Fastest-Growing Energy Source - Wind Energy Could Power Every =
Home in Europe by 2020' </p>


<p>FOX ISLAND, Wash., March 3 /PRNewswire/ -- First National Power Corp =
(OTC Bulletin Board: FNPR - News) from an Article published, LONDON, =
March 1 /CNW/ -- Every home in Europe could be powered by clean green =
offshore wind energy, according to a new report released by =
international energy experts. Researchers at the respected Garrad Hassan =
group examined wind speeds, sea depths, economic infrastructure and =
advancements in offshore wind technology. They concluded that as many as =
50,000 turbines could be built in European seas, generating the =
equivalent of 720 billion domestic units of electricity -- enough to =
power well over 150 million homes.</p>
<p>The report -- entitled "Sea Wind Europe" -- predicts the European =
wind industry is about to expand hugely, with major construction =
projects off countries including Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, =
France and Spain. It says wind could supply almost a third of all =
Europe's electricity needs including industry, service sector and =
domestic needs -- a comparable amount to that currently supplied by the =
entire EU nuclear industry.</p>=20

   <p>The researchers go on to say that by 2020 wind power could:<br>
    -- create up to 3 million jobs across Europe<br>
    -- rejuvenate declining industries and depressed industrial =
areas<br>
    -- create a multi-million euro renewable energy market<br>
    -- set Europe on the road to a completely clean energy supply system =
that<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is safe, secure and environmentally =
sustainable<br>
    -- provide cheaper electricity than both coal and nuclear power.<br>
   </p>

<p>"Canada holds the bulk of North American wind potential and yet we're =
lagging behind in terms of both wind production and investment," said =
Steven Guilbeault from Greenpeace. "The Canadian government is missing a =
great opportunity to be a leader in the field of renewable energy, =
instead of which it continues to favor polluting fossil fuels and =
nuclear energy."</p>

<p>"World leaders are facing the massive twin problems of energy =
security and climate change. This report shows that wind farms at sea, =
and on land, can be the backbone of the world's clean energy future, =
putting an end to the lie that renewable energy can't deliver on a large =
scale. What is true for Europe could also be true for Canada if Paul =
