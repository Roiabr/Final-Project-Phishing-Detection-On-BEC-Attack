			  <p><strong>ASP Industry </strong><br>
                <strong>What Is An Application Service Provider (ASP) =
</strong><br>
An application service provider (ASP) is a company that offers =
individuals or groups access over the Internet to software applications =
and related services that would otherwise have to be located in their =
own personal or enterprise computers. ASP services are expected to =
become an important alternative, not only for smaller companies with low =
budgets for information technology, but also for larger companies as a =
form of outsourcing and for many services for individuals as well. </p>

              <p>Early applications include: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Remote access serving for the users of an enterprise =
</li>
                <li>An off-premises local area network to which mobile =
users can be connected, with a common file server </li>
                <li>Specialized applications that would be expensive to =
install and maintain within your own company or on your own computer =
</li>
              </ul>
              <p>While ASPs are forecast to provide applications and =
services to small enterprises and individuals on a pay-per-use or yearly =
license basis, larger corporations are essentially providing their own =
ASP service in-house, moving applications off personal computers and =
putting them on a special kind of application server that is designed to =
handle the stripped-down kind of thin client workstation. This allows an =
enterprise to reassert the central control over application cost and =
usage that corporations formerly had in the period prior to the advent =
of the PC. Microsoft&#39;s Terminal Server product and Citrix&#39;s =
WinFrame products are leading thin-client application server products. =
</p>
              <p><strong>MSP Industry </strong></p>
              <p><strong>What is an MSP? </strong><br>
  The managed service provider (MSP) phenomenon is between 18 and 24 =
months old and is attracting a lot of attention from potential users and =
service providers wanting to add value. But different providers define =
it different ways, and service offerings range from the very limited to =
the very broad. <br>
  <br>
  A managed service provider delivers aspects of outsourced IT =
operations, usually via an IP network. All MSPs remotely manage network =
infrastructure on an ongoing basis, while some extend their offerings to =
provide and manage application infrastructure. Note: Some MSPs refer to =
themselves as &#39;management service providers. </p>
              <p><strong>Three main types of MSP </strong><br>
  In today&#39;s market, three main types of MSP can be distinguished. =
They differ in terms of: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The range of services offered </li>
                <li>The amount of responsibility they take for a =
client&#39;s business </li>
                <li>Scope - that is, the size of the MSP and the size of =
their target customer </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>The low level - pure-play MSPs </strong><br>
  This group of MSPs describe themselves as &#39;management service =
providers&#39;, not &#39;managed service providers&#39;. Many of the =
members of the year-old MSP Association fall into this category. The =
defining principle here is that these MSPs assist client companies in =
managing network infrastructure and limit themselves primarily to =
monitoring the performance of the network and of applications running =
over the network. They deliver services remotely via an IP network, =
sometimes by gathering data from a client&#39;s site via a networked =
server placed on site. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Range of services </strong><br>
  Watching uptime, performance and availability are the central value =
propositions of this type of MSP, although many in this category are =
expanding into extended infrastructure services, such as security, =
storage and testing. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Level of responsibility </strong><br>
  This type of MSP takes little, if any, responsibility for a =
client&#39;s business. If it offers a service-level agreement, it is =
likely to be for the uptime of its own monitoring process, not for the =
client&#39;s website. Its activities might be limited to reporting and =
alerts if a website experiences problems, or might extend to generating =
and tracking problem reports. If it extends its offerings to include =
security and storage, its responsibility level may increase accordingly. =
<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Scope </strong><br>
  MSPs at this level tend to be small (50-300 employees). Their clients =
will be SMEs with IT departments that are either understaffed, taken up =
with major projects, or focused on non-infrastructure core competencies. =
Clients tend to engage a low-level MSP for one aspect of infrastructure =
monitoring; if the relationship develops satisfactorily, they will then =
add additional services over time. <br>
  <br>
  This level of MSP is attempting to make MSP work as a business model, =
which will have short-term success at best. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The mid-level - MSP as a value-added service </strong><br>
  Mid-level MSPs tend to describe themselves as &#39;managed service =
providers&#39; and to offer a broader range of services that take =
greater responsibility for a client&#39;s business. </p>
              <p><strong>Range of services </strong><br>
  These MSPs may move beyond performance monitoring and reporting to =
software patches, installation and upgrades, and application =
infrastructure provision, which require them to be proficient in web =
application servers. An MSP at this level will take pride in offering as =
wide a range of services as possible, seeing this as a differentiator. =
<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Level of responsibility </strong><br>
  Mid-level MSPs also differentiate themselves by assuming greater =
responsibility for the functioning of a client&#39;s business. If a site =
goes down, they will do more than notification - they will work with the =
client to restore function. Service-level agreements reflect this level =
of responsibility. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Scope </strong><br>
  MSPs at this level can be large, as managed service will be folded in =
to other service offerings, such as web hosting or network provision. =
They target the Fortune 500 or 1,000 enterprise as a customer, although =
many also serve medium-sized clicks-and-mortar companies. <br>
  <br>
  Web-hosting providers such as Digex offer MSP at this level as a =
value-added service to their core service provision, which is hosting =
websites. Major Telcos such as Cable &amp; Wireless and France Telecom =
(via Equant and Global One) offer MSP as well. Loudcloud is probably the =
best-known example of a pure-play MSP that has grown its business =
successfully in past years, although it is currently struggling to make =
the concept work in an inhospitable economy. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The high level - outsourcing IT operations </strong><br>
  These MSPs undertake to allow clients to outsource their entire IT =
operation, if desired - truly one-stop shopping. They can also provide =
lower levels of service, like a mid-level MSP. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Range of services </strong><br>
  MSPs at this level offer a full range of traditional managed service =
and add aspects of application handling, such as integration and even =
application hosting, which can be defined as &#39;one-to-one remote =
custom outsourcing of applications. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Level of responsibility </strong><br>
