				<p>CINM is a wireless services company and creator of =
PocketCinema&#8482; multimedia.   The Hollywood-based studio produces =
downloadable video, applications and graphics for a global audience. =
CINM was founded by filmmaker James F. Robinson in 1999 and is based at =
the Los Angeles Center Studio complex in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>CINM owns what is believed to be the world's largest library of =
multimedia & graphic content for mobile devices, with a focus on global =
distribution of advanced mobile data services. Mobile data services are =
key to network operators as they work to capitalize on new high-speed =
networks and the current boom in color mobile phones sales. CINM =
produces their multimedia content in a wide variety of mobile formats, =
to optimize the user experience and value. The content is customized for =
Nokia, Motorola, Seimens, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, LG and other popular =
handsets.</p>

Services</strong></font></p>

<p>The telecom industry has invested heavily in high-speed wireless =
(cellular) networks, and in the sales and marketing of color multimedia =
mobile phones. These next-generation mobile phones are experiencing =
impressive growth in mature markets as users "trade up" to color =
terminals and add services like picture messaging and video downloads.  =
In addition, developing territories such as Eastern Europe, India and =
China are adding first-time mobile subscribers in dramatic numbers, many =
of whom are starting out with multimedia enabled phones.</p>=20

<p>These new mobile phones are important to mobile network operators =
(carriers) in that they facilitate in the development of data sales =
growth to complement a mature voice communication business.  Mobile =
phone manufacturers such as Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Panasonic, Seimens, =
Motorola and Samsung, are betting heavily on consumer&#39s migration to =
Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) and color phones as the standard, in =
much the same way as color screened PCs are the standard today.</p>=20

<p>Forrester Research predicted Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) =
revenues of USD $2 billion in 2003 and USD $48 billion in 2006. These =
new graphics delivery systems allow users to enhance their text messages =
with graphics, animations, small video clips and audio.  Juniper =
Research has estimated that MMS revenues will reach USD $8.3 billion by =
2004. USD $5.6bn is expected to be generated by third party content =
delivery of the kind of content the Company produces.</p>

<p>According to Industry estimates, there are currently more than 1.3 =
billion mobile phone subscribers globally.</p>
