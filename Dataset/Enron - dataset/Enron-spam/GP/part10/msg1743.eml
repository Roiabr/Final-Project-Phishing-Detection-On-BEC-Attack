completing the final phase of its financing, TIC had secured funding for =

<p>Since the settlement TIC has been working on securing and additional =
$1,000,000 in financing on top of the $300,000 it has already received.  =
Originally TIC was seeking funding up to $1,700,000, but since the =

  </p>
<p>Philip Mistretta, president of TIC, stated "The additional capital =

a financially responsible company and will enable TIS to begin bidding =

will result in higher profits margins and earnings per share for TIC =
shareholders".  </p>

<p>TIC is developing opportunities within the $13 billion signage =
industry with the goal of becoming the place for corporate America to go =
for their custom sign needs. TIC initial plans are to acquire various =
plants located on the Eastern seaboard, giving TIC a strong presence =
along the East Coast through the Midwest. TIC is looking at various sign =
companies that will allow TIC to absorb their operations and cut out all =
upper management and in some cases shift operations to its existing =
plant that has the capacity to generate $40 million a year in revenues =
by adding additional shifts.</p>
