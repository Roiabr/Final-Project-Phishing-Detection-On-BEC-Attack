<p>RONKONKOMA, NY: March 29, 2004; Perma-Tune Electronics, Inc., a =

today announced the signing of a Letter of Intent with a Major =
Motorcycle Aftermarket Vendor to distribute Plasmatronics' (a division =

Letter of Intent will be converted to an order within approximately 45 =

represents sales of approximately $2,000,000.</p>=20

<p>The Motorcycle Aftermarket Vendor will be purchasing specially =
configured and manufactured Plasma Drive Ignition Systems. The Plasma =

by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) or aftermarket vendors.  Tests =
show significant increases in fuel mileage and an increase in horsepower =

understand what we've done with the Plasma Drive Ignition, you must =
throw out everything you knew about motorcycle ignition. This =

				<p>TMXT is a rapidly emerging player in the multi-billion dollar =
specialty electronics arena.</p> =20

<p>TMXT's heralded product line possesses a myriad of significant =
performance, durability and price advantages that appeal to a diverse =
range of automotive, boating and trucking segments.</p> =20

<p>Interestingly, according to management, yearly numbers for engine =
manufacturing are 12,000,000 for the domestic auto industry and 125,000 =
for the marine industry. TMXT estimates the domestic market to be =
conservatively in excess of $2,000,000,000 for OEM ignition systems.</p> =


<p>These projections do not include foreign sales, which are recognized =
as being approximately double domestic sales. TMXT's other products are =
a bit more difficult to project. No other products exist in these =
categories so a somewhat conservative approach has been factored in =
TMXT's projections.</p> =20

<p>To project this first year, start-up numbers, TMXT has made several =
assumptions: TMXT will occupy its new factory with controlled conditions =
for sales and production; necessary personnel will be on board; and, a =
dynamic new marketing phase will be launched for its new products, =
including advertising and promotion.</p>

<p><font color=3D"#006633">Management estimates that in the first year, =
it is reasonable to expect sales to come approach 4,000 units. Average =
price per unit is approximately $650, for gross sales of $2,600,000.  =
TMXT's other products are to contribute approximately $2,000,000 to =
first year sales. Gross profit margins are projected to range from 30% =
to 75% depending on the order size and purchaser.</font></p>=20

<p><font color=3D"#006633">TMXT projects in the near future to capture =
3% of the combined projected market. This could equate to sales of =
$120,000,000.</font></p>

<p>To round out its dazzling display of products and services, TMXT =
plans to unveil its FLAT PANEL DISPLAY:  Perma-Tune Electronics is =
currently designing a revolutionary new touch-screen, flat-panel pilot =
instrumentation display for the marine industry.  The panel will be =
fully visible in all light conditions, including direct sunlight.</p>=20

<p> A wide variety of engine performance parameters can be =
simultaneously monitored by the pilot, while concurrently displaying =
global positioning, sonar and radar data.  This one central display =
simplifies the pilot's job and un-clutters the dashboard.  Bulky, =
failure-prone wiring harness bundles can be eliminated with this =
product, since a single RS-232 computer cable connects the engine =
management system to the display.</p>=20

<p>Additional devices can be connected with a single RS-232 computer =
cable.  Indeed, we're talking of a highly-fragmented environment, with =
such players as: Crane Ignition Systems, Seamens Ignition Systems, =
Delphi Ignition Systems, Saab Motor Company, Motorola Ignition Systems, =
Bosh and MSD.  Such quality names appear to soon be joined by TMXT as it =
unveils its unparalleled proprietary technologies.</p>                   =
