of a Foreign Partner who can receive this money in our behalf for =
investment purposes.<BR>
<BR>
Now the war in Sierra Leone is over with the help of United Nations and =
ECOMOG soldiers, the present government of Sierra-Leone has revoked the =

I needed from you is to furnish me with your bank particulars:<BR>
1. Account name<BR>

welfare.<BR>

Honestly, I want you to believe that, this transaction is real and never =
a joke. The photocopy of the Certificate of Deposit issued to my late =
father by the bank on the date of deposit is still intact with us, for =

believed that you will be able to keep this transaction secret for me =
because this money is the hope of our life, hope you understand. Please =
