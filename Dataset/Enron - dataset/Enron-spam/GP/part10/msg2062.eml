When we think we lead we are most led.<BR>
It's not the having, it's the getting.<BR>
There is something terribly wrong with a culture inebriated by noise and =
gregariousness.<BR>
Because people have no thoughts to deal in, they deal cards, and try and =
win one another's money. Idiots!<BR>
There is only one way left to escape the alienation of present day =
society: to retreat ahead of it.<BR>
Always do what you are afraid to do.<BR>
Revolve your world around the customer and more customers will revolve =
around you.<BR>
Democracy is supposed to give you the feeling of choice, like Painkiller =
X and Painkiller Y. But they're both just aspirin.<BR>
A horse never runs so fast as when he has other horses to catch up and =
outpace.<BR>
At last God caught his eye.<BR>
Other nations use ''force'' we Britons alone use ''Might.''<BR>
Remain calm, serene, always in command of yourself. You will then find =
out how easy it is to get along.<BR>
The fewer our wants the more we resemble the Gods.<BR>
