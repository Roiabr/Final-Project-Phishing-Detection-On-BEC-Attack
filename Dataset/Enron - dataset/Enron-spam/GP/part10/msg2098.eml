Dear,<BR>
<BR>
I got your contact in searching for a reliable and<BR>
trust worthy person to handle risk free transaction.<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr. Benson Briggs account Manager of United Bank<BR>
International (UBI) Switzerland. I have urgent and<BR>
very confidential business proposition for you. On<BR>
December 29th 2002, an American contractor with the<BR>
Government of Switzerland, Mr. Michael Creek made a<BR>
numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar<BR>
months, valued at Thirty-five Million dollars<BR>
(35million) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a<BR>
routine notification to his forwarding address but got<BR>
no reply.<BR>
<BR>
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we<BR>
discovered from his contract employers, that Mr.<BR>
Michael Creek died from an automobile accident. On<BR>
further investigation, I found out that he did not<BR>
leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin<BR>
were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation<BR>
and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not<BR>
declare any next of kin in all his official documents,<BR>
including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of<BR>
35million is still sitting in United Bank<BR>
International and the interest is being rolled over<BR>
with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one<BR>
will come forward to claim it.<BR>
<BR>
According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of<BR>
5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership<BR>
of the Government if nobody applies to claim the<BR>
funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like<BR>
you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the<BR>
next of kin to Mr. Michael creek so that the fruits of<BR>
this old man's labour will not get into the hands of<BR>
some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like<BR>
you to provide me immediately with your full names and<BR>
address so that the attorney will prepare the<BR>
necessary documents and affidavits, which<BR>
will put you in place as the next of kin.<BR>
<BR>
We shall employ the services of two attorneys for<BR>
drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the<BR>
necessary documents and letter of<BR>
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.<BR>
A bank account in any part of the world, which you<BR>
will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of<BR>
this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The<BR>
money will be paid into your account for us to share<BR>
in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you while 10%<BR>
will be set aside for miscellaneous expenses.<BR>
<BR>
There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every<BR>
necessary paperwork for this fund, will be done by the<BR>
attorney and my position as the Branch Manager<BR>
guarantees the successful execution of this<BR>
transaction.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Best Regards<BR>
Mr. Benson Briggs (GP)<BR>
