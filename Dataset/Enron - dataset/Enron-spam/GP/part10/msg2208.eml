Undervalued Market Report For Largest Percentage<BR>
Gain Leaders<BR>
<BR>
Opening Price: 2 cents<BR>
Immediate Target: 10 cents in 10 days<BR>
Near-Term Proj. High: 25 cents<BR>
Current Market Value (Approx): 1.5 million<BR>
<BR>
**Our Picks Are On Fire!**<BR>
Our last pick for huge percentage gains (GDLS) soared from<BR>
.23 to .83 (261% on 3/29) immediately following our report.<BR>
We believe the gains for ARET will run circles around all<BR>
our other picks for the year.<BR>
<BR>
Rising oil prices at record highs with no signs of dropping have<BR>
set the stage for a major windfall in an emerging developer of<BR>
high-profit based oil and gas reserves (Ticker: ARET). Significant<BR>
short term trading profits are being predicted as shares of Arete<BR>
Industries, Inc. are set to explode based on expanded production<BR>
through strategic partnerships for producing fields in 4 major<BR>
oil-producing states.<BR>
<BR>
ARET just released major news and we believe there is much more<BR>
to follow. There is strong evidence of big block buying indicating<BR>
that an explosive move is coming on a huge near-term announcement.<BR>
<BR>
As recently reported, ARET is executing the launch of a $1 Billion<BR>
financed &quot;Master Energy Fund&quot; which is capped at $100 =
Million<BR>
increments to fund the Company's energy projects. The value of<BR>
these projects has shot-up substantially since initially evaluated<BR>
on the heels of constant pressure for oil prices to climb. OPEC's<BR>
decision last week to cut production in support of even higher oil<BR>
prices will have a far-reaching effect on the bottom line of this<BR>
unknown junior oil-play hardwired for profits.<BR>
<BR>
ARET has maintained a leading role in each project thus enabling<BR>
the Company to earn net revenue and overriding production royalties<BR>
from oil and gas wells in proven fields, with predictable asset<BR>
values and income streams now on the upswing that present the<BR>
greatest near-term financial reward.<BR>
<BR>
While many energy companies are strapped for cash and unable to<BR>
develop, ARET's financing commitment is smashing down those =
barriers.<BR>
ARET is on the fast track to evolve into a major independent oil<BR>
and gas producer preparing to announce &quot;first-look&quot; deals =
with<BR>
domestic and international energy companies who realize that the<BR>
funding structure will enhance profitability.<BR>

How many times have you seen issues explode but you couldn't get =
your<BR>
hands on them or didn't have the right information in time? We are<BR>
alerting you now to an undervalued Company in play due to the =
hottest<BR>
topic in the country; soaring energy prices with clear signals for<BR>
greater price increases on the horizon. Frenzied block buying will<BR>
dominate trading as ARET has a market value under $2 million which<BR>
we believe will enable the stock to move very quickly as the value<BR>
of their oil and gas deals are revealed.<BR>
