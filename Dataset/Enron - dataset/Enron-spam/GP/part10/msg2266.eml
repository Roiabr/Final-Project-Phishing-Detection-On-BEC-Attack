customers as well as route all voice traffic through Spantel. Spantel's =
president, Jose Ramon Basterra, explained, "We are very happy that =
months of negotiations are finally coming to fruition. Many of the =
alternative carriers continue to contact Spantel with proposals that =
could greatly enhance our overall financial position in the coming =
years. We are evaluating all of these opportunities and are aggressively =
pursuing those that will give us an immediate or enhanced presence in =
areas we have targeted for expansion."</p>

<p>Spantel has entered into agreements with three alternative carriers =
this year and are continuing to pursue negotiations with others. As a =
result of these agreements, Spantel is enhancing its image as a national =
carrier with a physical presence in these important regions. Spantel =
anticipates these agreements to increase overall traffic by 35% and =
immediately be accretive in 2004.</p>
