<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;Good day,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I am Kingsley Muntu, decillion finacial services South Africa. =
This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp; is an urgent and confidential business proposition.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;On June 14, 2000, a foreign consultant with the Global Oil =
Corporation,<BR>
Mr. Alan Baker made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve =
calendar<BR>
months, valued at US$8,320,000.00, with us. Upon maturity. I sent a =
routine<BR>
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, =
a<BR>
reminder was sent and finally it was discovered from his contract =
employers,<BR>
Global Oil Corporation that Mr. Baker passed away.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;On further investigation, I found out that he died without making =
a will<BR>
or a testament, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. =
I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp; also discovered that Mr. Baker did not declare any kin =
or<BR>
relations in any of his official documents, including his deposit =
paperwork<BR>
in my possession. This has been fixed under our management. No one will =
ever<BR>
come forward to claim it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner =
to stand<BR>
in as the beneficiary to this investment. I am writing to you because =
I<BR>
cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the =
beneficiary<BR>
of the funds so that you claim on my behalf with the help of my =
attorney.<BR>
Please provide me with your full names and address so that my =
attorney<BR>
prepares the necessary documents, which will put you in place as the<BR>
beneficiary to this investment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that =
this<BR>
transaction will be of mutual benefit, as you will be entitled to 30% =
of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the money and the remaining 70% for my =
own investment. If you are<BR>
interested, reply me by email for further details.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Kind regards,<BR>
&nbsp;kingsley Muntu.<BR>
