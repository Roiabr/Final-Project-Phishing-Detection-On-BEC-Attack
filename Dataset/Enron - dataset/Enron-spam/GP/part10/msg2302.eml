ATTN: MD/CEO<BR>
<BR>
I am Dr Rawling Dike, Branch Manager with United<BR>
Bank For Africa,ILupeju Branch, Lagos, Nigeria.<BR>
<BR>
I have an urgent and very profitable business<BR>
proposition for you that should be handled with<BR>
extreme confidentiality.<BR>
<BR>
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Consultant and<BR>
contractor with the Nigerian Railway Corporation<BR>
Mr. Abbas Gumeri by name made a numbered time Fixed<BR>
Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$38.6M<BR>
(Thirty Eight Million, Six Hundred United States<BR>
Dollars Only) in my branch.<BR>
<BR>
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification in<BR>
accordance with the Bank policy to his forwarding<BR>
address but got no reply.<BR>
<BR>
After a month we sent a reminder and finally we<BR>
discovered from his contract employers Nigerian<BR>
Railway Corporation that Mr. Abbas Gumeri died from an<BR>
automobile accident.<BR>
<BR>
On further investigation, we found out that he died<BR>
without making a Will and all attempts to trace his<BR>
next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further<BR>
investigations and discovered that Mr. Abbas Gumeri<BR>
did not declare any next of kin or relations in all<BR>
his official documents including his Bank Deposit<BR>
paperwork in my Bank.<BR>
<BR>
This sum of US$38.6M has been carefully moved out of<BR>
my bank to a Financial and Security Company in Europe<BR>
for safekeeping.<BR>
<BR>
No one will ever come forward to claim it and<BR>
according to the Law of my country, at the expiration<BR>
of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of<BR>
the State (Government) if nobody applies to claim the<BR>
fund.<BR>
<BR>
This prompted us to contact you.We want to front<BR>
you as the next of kin of our late client thereby<BR>
making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $38.6<BR>
million U.S Dollars that is presently in a Financial<BR>
and Security Company in Europe.<BR>
<BR>
I contacted you because it is against our code of<BR>
ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your<BR>
assistance would be needed to claim the money in the<BR>
Financial and Security Company in Europe.<BR>
<BR>
We have unanimously agreed that 25% of the entire sum<BR>
would be for you if you agree to take part in this<BR>
profitable transaction,65% for me while the remaining<BR>
10% would be used to pay back the expenses that may be<BR>
incurred during the course of the transaction by both<BR>
parties after the fund has been claimed and lodged in<BR>
your account.<BR>
<BR>
In the event that you are genuinely interested in the<BR>
transaction,the following information would be needed<BR>
from you to expedite action.<BR>
<BR>
1) Your Full Name .<BR>
<BR>
2) Your Residential or Company Address.<BR>
<BR>
3) Your Private Mobile,Telphone and Fax numbers where<BR>
you can be reached at all time because this<BR>
transaction entails constant communication.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The transaction is 100% legal and totally free of<BR>
risks as all modalities has been perfected to ensure<BR>
the hitch free success of the transaction.<BR>
<BR>
If you are interested, send the requested information<BR>
via email as soon as possible so that we can proceed<BR>
and after sending it you call me.<BR>
<BR>
I await your response urgently.<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
<BR>
Dr Rawling Dike.<BR>
