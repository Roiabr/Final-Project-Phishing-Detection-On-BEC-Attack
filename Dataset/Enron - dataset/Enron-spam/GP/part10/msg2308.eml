A party of visitors were being shown round a lunatic asylum. they =
came<BR>
across one individual in the grounds , with wild eyes, disheveled =
hair,<BR>
feverishly endeavoring to catch flies and keep them in his =
pocket.&quot;His was a<BR>
sad case,&quot; said the attendant. &quot;Whilst he was at the war his =
wife abandoned<BR>
his home and ran off with another man.&quot;&quot;Terrible&quot;, said a =
visitor.Presently<BR>
the y came to a padded cell, in which could be heard a raging as of a =
wild<BR>
beast.&quot;That's the other man, &quot; said the attendant<BR>
A young man saw an elderly couple sitting down to lunch at McDonald's. =
He<BR>
noticed that they had ordered one meal, and an extra drink cup. As =
he<BR>
watched, the older gentleman carefully divided the hamburger in half, =
then<BR>
counted out the fries, one for him, one for her, until each had half =
of<BR>
them. Then the old man poured half of the soft drink into the extra cup =
and<BR>
set that in front of his wife. The old man then began to eat, and his =
wife<BR>
sat watching, with her hands folded in her lap. The young man decided to =
ask<BR>
if they would allow him to purchase another meal for them so that =
they<BR>
didn't have to split theirs. The old gentleman said, &quot;Oh, no. We've =
been<BR>
married 50 years, and everything has always been and will always be =
shared,<BR>
50/50.&quot; The young man then asked the wife if she was going to eat, =
and she<BR>
replied, &quot;Not yet. It's his turn with the teeth.<BR>
