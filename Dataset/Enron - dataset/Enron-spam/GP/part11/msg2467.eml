is referred to in medical science as the master hormone. It is very =
plentiful
when we are young, but near the age of twenty-one our bodies begin to =
produce
less of it. By the time we are forty nearly everyone is deficient in =
HGH,
and at eighty our production has normally diminished at least 90-95%.
