<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL<BR>
<BR>
I am paul maga,former Bank manager of<BR>
CITI INTERNATIONAL BANK,welma street,johanesburg.<BR>
read through my message. THIS IS NOT A SPAM MAIL!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have very urgent and confidential business<BR>
proposition for you. On June 6th 1999, an Oil<BR>
Consultant/Contractor with the south-african<BR>
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa ,<BR>
a national of pakistan, made a numbered time ( fixed)<BR>
deposit for 12 calendar months, value<BR>
USD18,000,000.00<BR>
in my branch.<BR>
<BR>
On maturity, i sent a routine notification to his<BR>
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,<BR>
i sent a reminder and finally, his contract<BR>
employers, the south african Petroleum Corporation.<BR>
<BR>
wrote to inform me that Mr. A Y Mustafa has been absent without =
leave.<BR>
and is assumed he has left the co-operation.i was worried<BR>
with this development considering his immense deposit in the bank<BR>
all attempts to trace his whereabout&nbsp;<BR>
through the pakistani embassy were fruitless. At first<BR>
I was surprised that I did not receive much official<BR>
cooperation in my inquiries in order to trace his<BR>
whereabout, and inform them about Mr. Mustafams<BR>
deposit of USD18m plus accrued interest.<BR>
I therefore made further investigations and<BR>
discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the<BR>
Government of President pervez mussharaf,<BR>
was<BR>
consequently driven into exile. Being an Oil<BR>
Expert,he subsequently obtained a job with the SAPC,<BR>
and<BR>
settled in SOuTH AFRICA . Thereafter, he walked into my<BR>
Office to make the aforementioned deposit of<BR>
USD18m. He did not declare any kin in his application<BR>
paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and when<BR>
I asked him he informed me that<BR>
he wished it so. I accepted his application because<BR>
banks are conservative and will always honor a<BR>
customers<BR>
wishes, especially high networth customers.<BR>
No one knows the source of his money because<BR>
apparently the time frame of his employment with<BR>
the SAPC does indeed preclude such a large amount of<BR>
money. It can be assumed that he brought his money<BR>
over from PAKISTAN, but that is open to speculation.<BR>
However, the point is that his employers are not<BR>
aware of this money ,last year i was unceremoniusly<BR>
relieved of my duty as the bank manager,and i decided to do my =
personal<BR>
investigation as regards the whereabout of mr mustafa,this was how i =
came<BR>
to pakistan this year and after 2 weeks of careful investigation i =
discovered that<BR>
mr mustafa had been a close alley of president saddam hussein of =
iraq<BR>
and had travvelled to iraq at the heat of the crises in iraq were he =
met<BR>
his untimely death.<BR>
No one will ever come<BR>
forward to claim the money now, and according to SOUTH-AFRICAN<BR>
law,<BR>
after 5 years, the money will automatically revert<BR>
to the Federal Government Treasury if the Account<BR>
owner is a foreigner,and is certified dead , and there is<BR>
no<BR>
valid claim. This indeed, is the situation. My<BR>
proposal therefore is that I am looking for a<BR>
foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to<BR>
Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood<BR>
relation<BR>
to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also<BR>
necessary to come from the same Country. I have<BR>
worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of<BR>
appointing<BR>
a next of kin, and therefore also by this means<BR>
transfer this money total USD18.5m abroad for us to<BR>
share.<BR>
<BR>
The method of achieving this objective is as follows<BR>
i shall supply you with the account number,the original<BR>
deposit certificate and other sworn affidavits that you would<BR>
require as the next of kin.i already have some of these documents in =
my<BR>
possesion as i was careful enough to get them before i left the =
bank,<BR>
others i dont have now i shall talk to an attorney who is a friend of =
mine<BR>
to get for me.then you shall contact the bank claiming beneficiary =
of<BR>
the funds.<BR>
dear friend i want you to be assured that the way i had planned this<BR>
transfer is bound to succed and completely risk free for both us<BR>
<BR>
If you therefore agree to be the official<BR>
Beneficiary, then please reply my mail as i shall give you further<BR>
directive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking forward to your urgent reply.<BR>
<BR>
Yours truly<BR>
paul maga.<BR>
