   UDVE with huge reserves and expanded production to jump 500%.<P>

Our precious metals and mining HOT-PICKS for the last 12 months have
gained an average  of  476%?e  are  expecting earth-shattering news
that will send shockwaves through our latest pick UDVE.<P>

UDVE controls 3 of the largest  gold  mining  properties  in  Guyana
(South  America)  including a 25-mile property with proven, verified
reserves exceeding  400,000  ounces  of  gold  valued  at  over $100
MILLI0N<P>

The Company is in a rapidly expanding state of gold production while
generating revenue and positive cash flow. UDVE has literally struck
gold with major funding news announced last week that  provides  $13
MILLI0N  for  the  purchase  of additional mining equipment enabling
accelerated production and record breaking PR0FITS.<P>

UDVE's breakout year is perfectly timed and will not go unnoticed as
PriceWaterhouseCoopers' head  mining  analyst,  Paul  Murphy, stated
just last month; "We seem to be at the start  of  the  first  mining
boom  of  the  twenty-  first century." This statement accompanied a
PriceWaterhouse report detailing the  record doubling of PR0FITS for
mining companies in 2003 with an even brighter outlook for 2004.<P>

Hot gold stocks are no longer taking a back seat  while  merger  and
takeover  activity is on the rise. Investors have scored major gains
on  several  recent   highly-publicized   battles   for  control  of
well-positioned gold producers with similar structure to UDVE.<P>

REUTERS Newswire reported last quarter that mergers and acquisitions
in gold mining companies are being completed  at  a  record  frantic
pace  with  the expectation of this trend increasing. Large-cap fund
managers and securities analysts agree  that the junior mining GR0UP
is especially more vulnerable to a b?y-out or takeover scenario  in
today's  healthy  mining  environment.   UDVE is viewed as a serious
takeover target based on their $140 MILLI0N revenue forecast, as the
price for this undervalued  asset  play  has  not even come close to
reaching its true potential.<P>

Judging by the numbers, the value of UDVE's proven  reserves  should
push  the  share  price higher with greater upside expected to match
their fast-paced growth. UDVE has  been heating up the newswire with
batches  of  positive  developments  regarding  production,  reserve
valuations, and  additional  property  acquisitions.  Combine  these
activities  with  classic  evidence of 60- day accumulation and it's
blatantly obvious that huge news  is  about to be released that will
have an explosive impact on shareholder value.<P>
