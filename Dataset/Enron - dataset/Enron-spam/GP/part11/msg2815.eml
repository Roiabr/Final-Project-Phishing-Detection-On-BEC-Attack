First it was gold, then oil, now Homeland Security is<BR>
the explosive sector turning savvy stock players into<BR>
millionaires.<BR>
HSTJ is our Homeland Defense Hot Pick commanding immediate<BR>
investor attention.<BR>
HSTJ is an extremely undervalued player in the hottest<BR>
market sector while simultaneously declaring a stock<BR>
dividend of 30%. We are anticipating several revenue<BR>
related news announcements and a surge of activity by<BR>
brokers and investors to participate in a massive share<BR>
price breakout. Price and volume for HSTJ will be soaring<BR>
as word gets out revealing that shareholders will receive<BR>
the 30% stock bonus which is roughly equal to a 4 for<BR>
3 stock split.<BR>
<BR>
We have identified large block buying and active accumulation<BR>
in HSTJ that is linked to major corporate news events. HSTJ<BR>
supplies military combat gear for the US Armed Forces and<BR>
was formed for this purpose by highly decorated military<BR>
leaders. Not surprisingly, HSTJ has experienced a strong<BR>
increase in monthly orders. Keep watch for an expanded<BR>
product line as hinted by the Company in recent press in<BR>
conjunction with additional orders.<BR>
<BR>
Any issue involved in Homeland Defense with elite military<BR>
management, continuous contracts, exponential growth, and<BR>
a Stock Split or Dividend is a launching pad for<BR>
incredible profits. The Company has a market value under<BR>
$1 Million which we believe will enable the stock to move<BR>
very quickly as the value of their contracts are revealed.<BR>
We expect the 30% stock dividend to create an added frenzy<BR>
by investors loading up before HSTJ goes through the roof.<BR>
