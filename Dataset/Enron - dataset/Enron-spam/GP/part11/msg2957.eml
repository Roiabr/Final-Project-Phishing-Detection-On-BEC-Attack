MEDG - Our Best Pick With Rapid Growth Expected.<BR>
<BR>
MediaNet Group Technologies (MEDG) $1.43. There<BR>
will be contracts with several Fortune 500 companies<BR>
being announced shortly. The very short term target<BR>
price is $3+. The company is expecting $4-5 million<BR>
to the bottom line in 2005. Based on 7 million shares<BR>
outstanding that would be earnings of $0.50 to $0.70<BR>
which would be a $5-7 target with a conservative P/E<BR>
of only 10. There are less than one million shares in<BR>
the float, so you could see a rapid price appreciation.<BR>
Trading above $1.50 should see the $3.00+ level early<BR>
in 2005. 78f56_2ax553wC1L6E25369wa2<BR>
