MISSOULA, MT /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- Golden Opportunity =
Resources, Inc., (OTC Pink: GDNO) a Nevada Corporation.<BR>
<BR>
Golden Opportunity Resources (GDNO-PK) has been informed by the =
company's joint venture partner and project operator, Big Snowy =
Resources LP, that the drilling of a well located 6,000 feet northwest =
of the hole Golden Opportunity is set to drill has been completed to =
target depth. The Bolero 1-23 Well has been cased and cemented. The =
primary target, the Tyler C Sand, was successfully intersected at 2,830 =
feet to 2,860 feet (863 to 872 metres).<BR>
<BR>
Schlumberger Oilfield Services Inc. completed two log reports to ensure =
accuracy of the data and has provided estimates for the potential of oil =
and gas in each of the five zones encountered. All five zones =
demonstrate potential commercial-grade and significant quantity of =
hydrocarbons (oil and gas), which is further corroborated by =
similarities to other neighboring offset wells, both within 400 feet =
(122 metres) of the Bolero 1-23 well.<BR>
<BR>
President of Golden Opportunity Resources William Morton stated &quot; =
We at Golden Opportunity are extremely encouraged by the recent =
discovery made just 6,000 feet from our hole which is set to be drilled =
in the next 10 days. Big Snowy has advised the company that the =
discovery hole is in the same Tyler formation as Golden Opportunity's =
hole to be drilled. This recent development just affirms our belief that =
the program we are set to embark upon is first rate. We are pleased to =
be working with Big Snowy and their team of experts with vast experience =
in this area. &quot;<BR>
