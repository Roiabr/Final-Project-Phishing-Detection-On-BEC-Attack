<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>DR RAYMOND SADIQ.<BR>
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT<BR>
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT<BR>
CREDIT BANK BENIN<BR>
COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC<BR>
WEST AFRICA.<BR>
<BR>
MY DEAR,<BR>
<BR>
I am DR RAYMOND SADIQ, the director in charge of<BR>
auditing and<BR>
accounting section of Credit Bank Benin republic in<BR>
West Africa with due<BR>
respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a<BR>
business transaction<BR>
that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end<BR>
of the<BR>
transaction.<BR>
<BR>
During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my<BR>
department came<BR>
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a<BR>
deceased person who died<BR>
on 30th january 2000 on Kenya Airways with aircraft<BR>
Airbus 310-304 at<BR>
location Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with registration<BR>
number 5Y-BEN while<BR>
travelling with his entire family, his wife, two<BR>
children and a maid on a<BR>
festive visit to Abidjan and since his untimely death<BR>
the funds has<BR>
been dormant in his account with this Bank without any<BR>
claim of the fund<BR>
in our custody either from his family or relation<BR>
before our discovery<BR>
to this development.<BR>
<BR>
Although personally, I kept this information secret<BR>
within myself and<BR>
partners to enable the whole plans and idea be<BR>
Profitable and successful<BR>
during the time of execution. The said amount was<BR>
USD$24.1M (twenty<BR>
four Million one Hundred Thousand united states<BR>
dollars).<BR>
<BR>
As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive<BR>
information<BR>
through my good friend who works with chamber of<BR>
commerce on foreign<BR>
business relations here in Cotonou-Benin, it is him<BR>
who recommended your<BR>
person to me to be viable and capable to champion a<BR>
business of such<BR>
magnitude without any problem.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over<BR>
this fund as the<BR>
bonafide next of kin to the deceased and get the<BR>
required approval and<BR>
transfer this money to a foreign account has been put<BR>
in place, all<BR>
directives and needed information will be relayed to<BR>
you as soon as you<BR>
indicate your interest and willingness to assist us<BR>
and also benefit<BR>
yourself to this great business opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
In fact i could have done this deal alone but because<BR>
of my position in<BR>
this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to<BR>
operate a<BR>
foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow<BR>
on my side during the<BR>
time of transfer because i work in this bank.<BR>
<BR>
This is the actual reason why it will require a second<BR>
party or fellow<BR>
who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank<BR>
and also present<BR>
a foreign account where he will need the money to be<BR>
re-transferred<BR>
into on his request as it may be after due<BR>
verification and clarification<BR>
by the correspondent branch of the bank where the<BR>
whole money will be<BR>
remitted from to your<BR>
own designated bank account.<BR>
<BR>
May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is<BR>
100% risk free<BR>
as i have made all arrangements for a successful<BR>
transaction as an<BR>
insider of the bank before contacting you.<BR>
<BR>
On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be<BR>
entitled to 30%<BR>
of the total sum as gratification,<BR>
while 10% will be set aside to take care of any<BR>
expenses that may arise<BR>
during the time of transfer<BR>
like telephone bills, fax and our travel tickets to<BR>
come over to your<BR>
country for the sharing of the fund<BR>
while 60% will be for me and my partners.<BR>
<BR>
Please you have been advised to keep this a top secret<BR>
as we are still<BR>
in service and intend to retire from service after we<BR>
conclude this<BR>
deal with you.<BR>
<BR>
I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this<BR>
bank until you<BR>
confirm the money in your account and ask us to come<BR>
down to your country<BR>
for subsequent sharing of the fund according to<BR>
percentages<BR>
previously indicated and further investment either in<BR>
your country or<BR>
any country you will advice us to<BR>
invest in.<BR>
<BR>
All other necessary information will be sent to you on<BR>
your acceptance<BR>
to champion this transaction with me.<BR>
<BR>
I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible or<BR>
you contact me on<BR>
my private line 229 88 98 16<BR>
stating your wish in this deal.<BR>
<BR>
Yours Faithfully,<BR>
DR RAYMOND SADIQ<BR>
