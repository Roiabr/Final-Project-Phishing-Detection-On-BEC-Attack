Universal Trust Bank Nigeria Limited,<BR>

ATTN: MD/CEO<BR>
<BR>
i am Patrick Ojo, Branch Manager with Universal Trust Bank Nigeria<BR>
Limited, Victoria<BR>
Island Branch, Lagos,&nbsp; Nigeria.<BR>
I have an urgent and very profitable business proposition for you =
that<BR>
should be handled with extreme confidentiality.<BR>
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant and contractor in Nigeria<BR>
Mr. James Herbert by name made a numbered<BR>
time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$15.5M<BR>
(fifteen<BR>
Million, five Hundred United States Dollars Only) in my branch.<BR>
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification in accordance with the<BR>
Bank<BR>
policy<BR>
to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a<BR>
reminder<BR>
and finally we<BR>
discovered from his contract employers in Nigeria<BR>
that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident.<BR>
On further investigation, we found out that ! he died without making =
a<BR>
Will and<BR>
all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore =
made<BR>
further<BR>
investigations and discovered that Mr. James Herbert did not declare<BR>
any<BR>
&nbsp;next<BR>
of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank<BR>
Deposit<BR>
paperwork in my Bank.<BR>
This sum of US$15.5M has been carefully&nbsp; moved out of my bank to =
a<BR>
Security<BR>
Company in Europe for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to<BR>
claim it<BR>
and according to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 years the =
money<BR>
will revert<BR>
to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to =
claim<BR>
the fund.<BR>
This prompted us to contact you.We will like to front you as the =
next<BR>
of<BR>
&nbsp;kin<BR>
of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the =
sum<BR>
of $38.6<BR>
million U.S Dollars that is presently in a Security Company in =
Europe.<BR>
I contacted you because it is against our code of ethics to own ! =
and<BR>
operate<BR>
foreign accounts and your assistance would be needed to claim the<BR>
money<BR>
in the<BR>
Security Company in Europe.<BR>
We have unanimously agreed that 40% of the entire sum would be for =
you<BR>
if you<BR>
agree to take part in this profitable transaction,50% for me and 2 =
of<BR>
my<BR>
&nbsp;colleagues<BR>
while the remaining 10% would be used to pay back the expenses that<BR>
may<BR>
be incurred<BR>
during the<BR>
course of the transaction by both parties after the fund has been<BR>
claimed and<BR>
lodged in your account.<BR>
In the event that you are genuinely interested in the =
transaction,the<BR>
following<BR>
information would be needed from you to expedite action.<BR>
1) Your Full Name and Address that would be used to establish you as<BR>
the<BR>
&nbsp;next<BR>
of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary =
of<BR>
the fund.<BR>
This would ensure that the Security Company in Europe releases the<BR>
Consignment/Fund<BR>
to you.<BR>
2) Your Private Mobile,Telp! hone and Fax numbers where you can be<BR>
reached<BR>
&nbsp;at<BR>
all time because this transaction entails constant communication.<BR>
3)Your full banking information.<BR>
The transaction is 100% risk free as all modalities has been =
perfected<BR>
to ensure<BR>
the hitch free success of the transaction. If you are interested, =
send<BR>
the requested<BR>
information via email<BR>
I await your response urgently.<BR>
Regards,<BR>
<BR>
