&nbsp;Good day, and best wishes of the day with all honour and due&nbsp; =
respesct.I<BR>
am Mr.Osmond Brown, the Accountant General of a Bank in&nbsp; Africa.I =
humbly<BR>
request your kindest assistance in the transfer of&nbsp; money amounting =
to<BR>
$35.000,000.00 in my bank. On June. 1994, an oil =
consultant/contractor<BR>
with the oil ministry, Mr.Philip Morris, he made a fixed deposit =
of&nbsp; U.S<BR>
$35 million dollars in my bank. We sent a routine notification to&nbsp; =
his<BR>
forwarding address but got no reply.<BR>
&nbsp;After a month, we sent a remind errand;finally his employers wrote =
to<BR>
inform us that Mr.Morris died in an automobile accident, that he =
died<BR>
without making a will while our attempt to investigate his next of =
kin<BR>
proved fruitless only God knows why he made it this way..When he was<BR>
making deposition in my bank, he did not declare his next of kin =
in&nbsp; his<BR>
deposit application form, when I reminded him he said he wished it<BR>
&nbsp;so, in the conservative manner of our bank, I did not turn down =
his<BR>
request rather honor it considering his net worth. The point is =
that&nbsp; his<BR>
employers are not aware of his deposit with us; therefore I am the =
only<BR>
person who knows about Mr. Morris's deposit of $35,000,000.00&nbsp; =
which i<BR>
would not like to disclose to the government,which is now&nbsp; lying in =
a<BR>
dormant account portfolio.<BR>
&nbsp;I am looking forward for a reliable foreigner who will stand or =
assist<BR>
with good heart and trust as the next of kin to Mr. Morris. I have<BR>
worked out modalities of achieving my aim by appointing you as the&nbsp; =
next<BR>
of kin, as well as transfer the $35,000,000.00 abroad for us to&nbsp; =
share.<BR>
I will use an attorney who will represent you as the&nbsp; beneficiary =
to<BR>
series of affidavit in support of your claim including&nbsp; certificate =
of<BR>
origin of the money, power of attorney, which empowers&nbsp; you as the =
sole<BR>
trustee/executive to the estate of Morris. Please note&nbsp; that you =
may not<BR>
be required to sign any transfer document as the&nbsp; appointed =
attorney<BR>
will do all, if you are not able to come over.If&nbsp; you agree to act =
as<BR>
the next of kin/beneficiary to enable me&nbsp; transfer/convert the =
money to<BR>
our benefit use. I will give you 25% of&nbsp; total amount while 5% will =
take<BR>
care of any unforeseen expenses may&nbsp; incurred in the course of<BR>
concluding this transaction.<BR>
&nbsp;I am urgently and confidentially waiting for your earliest =
response<BR>
through my personal email address: brownmond@seeqmail.com<BR>
&nbsp;Thanks and God bless,<BR>
