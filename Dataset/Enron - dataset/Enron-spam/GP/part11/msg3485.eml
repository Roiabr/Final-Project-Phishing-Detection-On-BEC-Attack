Our Stock in the Spotlight is RS GR0UP&nbsp; of&nbsp; Companies,&nbsp; =
Inc.&nbsp; (BB:&nbsp; RSGC).&nbsp; By<BR>
taking&nbsp; a&nbsp; page&nbsp; from&nbsp; BILLI0NAIRE&nbsp; Warren =
Buffet's playbook and following the<BR>
Berkshire Hathaway model of&nbsp; acquiring&nbsp; or&nbsp; =
&quot;rolling-up&quot; high margin specialty<BR>
insurers, RSGC is racking up record sales and hardwired for PR0FITS.<BR>

RSGC is thriving in the&nbsp; ideal&nbsp; economic environment enabling =
the M0RTGAGE and<BR>

accomplishments<BR>
are turning heads in the specialty in-surance and reinsurance =
industry,as well<BR>
as&nbsp; capturing&nbsp; the&nbsp; profit-making&nbsp; attention&nbsp; =
of aggressive investors. We have<BR>
witnessed this&nbsp; Company&nbsp; evolve&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; =
last&nbsp; 60&nbsp; days&nbsp; into a strategically<BR>
positioned powerhouse by securing $15 MILLI0N plus&nbsp; in&nbsp; =
sales,&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to<BR>

<BR>
Following&nbsp; RS&nbsp; GR0UP's latest quarterly filing, the Company =
has re-ceived $8.5<BR>
MILLI0N in equity financing from institutional investors; these are the =
&quot;smart<BR>
money&quot; players that hold long term&nbsp; and&nbsp; recognize a =

the&nbsp; Berkshire&nbsp; Hathaway&nbsp; empire<BR>
(trading&nbsp; at&nbsp; over&nbsp; $80,000 per share), and built upon =
the explosive cash flow<BR>
from 3 in-surance subsidiaries (National Indemnity,GEICO, and General =

had a commanding effect on&nbsp; RSGC's&nbsp; successful penetration =
into the Lloyd's of<BR>
London in-surance market with 2 major acquisitions&nbsp; and&nbsp; an =
underwriting&nbsp; line<BR>

product. Even so, just the initial sales alone will impact the bottom =

of<BR>
approximately $400 MILLI0N.&quot; We are not the first to uncover&nbsp; =
this&nbsp; phenomenon<BR>
as&nbsp; the&nbsp; stock&nbsp; is&nbsp; under accumulation, but we are =
acting aggressively on this<BR>
recently filed data.<BR>
<BR>
Any company producing&nbsp; revenues&nbsp; at&nbsp; this&nbsp; =
extraordinary&nbsp; pace&nbsp; is going to be<BR>
eagerly pursued by investors along with&nbsp; rapid&nbsp; analyst&nbsp; =
