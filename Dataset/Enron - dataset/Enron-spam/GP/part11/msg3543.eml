<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear friend,<BR>
<BR>
Greetings to you and your family! This mail might come to you as a<BR>
surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come =
into<BR>
your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a<BR>
deep sense of humility. My name is Jose A. Martinez. I am a 64 years<BR>
old<BR>
man, I am<BR>
Cuban currently residing in Dubai (United Arab Emirate). I was =
formerly<BR>
living in Cuba and served under Castro`s government but had to run =
into<BR>
self exile after the ruling Government of Fidel Castro closed in on =
my<BR>
family on accusations of anti-government statements, I was once =
married<BR>
with two children but my family could not escape before the deadly<BR>
hands of Castro`s goons fell on them.<BR>
<BR>
l did made a lot of money serving Castro and on getting to UAE, I =
have<BR>
been a merchant here in Dubai dealing in rnamentals, Oriental =
Carpets<BR>
and Artifacts and life was very smooth for me until about =
three(3)&nbsp;<BR>
years ago when I was first diagnosed of Cancer of the Larynx. Before =
is<BR>
happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived =
for,<BR>
I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss =
of<BR>
my family and hometown, I have found a new desire to assist helpless<BR>
families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes.<BR>
<BR>
I have once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged Eritrea,<BR>
Somalia, Sudan and some East European Countries. Before I became ill, =
I<BR>
kept $4.5 Million(four million five hundred thousand us dollars) in =
a<BR>
long-term&nbsp; deposit vault in a bank in Europe and I didn`t state =
any<BR>
next<BR>
of kin when the money was deposited and if I died without stating =
any<BR>
the money will automatically go into the coffers of the bank and I<BR>
don`t<BR>
want this to happen. I have left the hospital and presently =
receiving<BR>
treatment in an acupuncture clinic, I have been undergoing treatment<BR>
for<BR>
Oesophageal Cancer at the hospital. I have since lost my ability to<BR>
talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to =
live.<BR>
It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity<BR>
organizations.<BR>
<BR>
Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth =
since<BR>
my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge<BR>
responsibility<BR>
to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me =
collect<BR>
the deposit and distribute it amongst charity organizations. Use =
your<BR>
judgement to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse =
yourself<BR>
when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of<BR>
collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. I am<BR>
going to send you vital documents to back my claims and I am willing =
to<BR>
offer you a reward If you are willing to help, please reply as soon =
as<BR>
you can to this email address<BR>
<BR>
Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Jose. A Martinez<BR>
