"The third product is a spray that works really well it&nbsp;<br>
puts a high gloss finish on your plate which causes&nbsp;<br>
a reflection and that makes the plate overexposed."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"So if you're gonna use a plate blocker i suggest<br>
the spray. The reflective spray does not obstruct<br>
plate numbers from the naked eye at all."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"Now the third product is that spray that is&nbsp;<br>
surprisingly effective, it puts a high gloss&nbsp;<br>
finish on your plate which causes a reflection&nbsp;<br>
that makes the plate overexposed so its&nbsp;<br>
practically impossible for police to spot&nbsp;<br>
plates that have been treated with the&nbsp;<br>
reflective spray and in many jurisdictions<br>
there's no specific rule that your tag&nbsp;<br>
must be photogenic."&nbsp;<br>

Denver Police say "it's surprisingly effective"&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"they are controversial, because, here's why, private&nbsp;<br>
companies actually own all the cameras,&nbsp;<br>
so what ends up happening is a lot of times&nbsp;<br>
the companies themselves get paid per ticket."&nbsp;<br>
-tech tv&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"This is a high gloss spray that even the bakersfield<br>
police department admits they have a hard time&nbsp;<br>
proving whats on your plate."&nbsp;<br>
