-- rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a =
length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which =
set it down as a mile in width and three in length -- we might fairly =

for him or not to follow me in my travels; but this time the expedition =
in question might be prolonged, and the enterprise might be hazardous in =
pursuit of an animal capable of sinking a frigate as easily as a =
nutshell!!! Captain Anderson went down immediately into the hold.<BR>
