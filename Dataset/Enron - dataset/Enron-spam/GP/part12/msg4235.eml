National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has<BR>
entered<BR>
into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in =
Match<BR>
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the<BR>
Mi||ennium International Tennis Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Millennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc.<BR>
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering<BR>
into<BR>
acquisition negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
Both loca| Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two<BR>
entities. &quot;Basically we're both from the same industry, and =
together I<BR>
believe<BR>
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one =
companies,&quot;<BR>
said Robert McA|lister, CEO &amp; President of Mil|ennium National =
Events.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the =
negotiations,<BR>
&quot;We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and be|ieve that there =
could be<BR>
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McA|lister also feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for<BR>
both Millennium shareholders and Match Point. &quot;This acquisition =
is<BR>
consistent with our overall business plan. It has a|ways been our<BR>
intent to<BR>
target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their =
promoters;<BR>
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. =
Consolidation<BR>
is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of<BR>
each individual event.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi||ennium sees =
the<BR>
Match Point acquisition ultimate|y being able to bring net revenues =
to<BR>
MNEI's bottom line.<BR>
<BR>
MNEI sees both the international television audience and the abi|ity =
to<BR>
attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as =
of<BR>
yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the dea| to be consummated =
in<BR>
this quarter.<BR>
