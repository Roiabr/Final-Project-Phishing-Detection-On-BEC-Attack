<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Traders' Monthly Alert<BR>
January Pick (BMXG) exploded from .20 to 2.07,<BR>
a gain of over 900% in 6 days (1/18 - 1/24)!<BR>
<BR>
Our next pick is an incredible find that will<BR>
outperform all others based on their solid<BR>
numbers, huge sales backlog,$2 Billion in<BR>
financing, low outstanding shares, and a deal<BR>
with Chinese Government-run companies totaling<BR>
$10 Billion!<BR>
<BR>
Urgent Buy at any Price:<BR>
Global Environmental Energy Corp.<BR>
OTCBB - GEEC<BR>
Current Price - 1.90<BR>
Running To - 6.00<BR>
<BR>
GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ<BR>
Diversified Industrials Index in the last 2 months. This<BR>
is a Dow Jones Industry Index that also contains 3M, GE,<BR>
and Honeywell.<BR>
<BR>
We are sending this URGENT INVESTOR BULLETIN REVEALING THE<BR>
MOST UNDERVALUED PICK ON THE OTCBB to our millions of<BR>
subscribers for substantial profits immediately!<BR>
GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume<BR>
indicating heavy accumulation of shares. This is a sign of<BR>
even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader<BR>
in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy,<BR>
an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible<BR>
to assign a value to the size of the market.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their<BR>
Biosphere Process System for the disposal of a wide variety<BR>
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major<BR>
impact on the global waste problem. This profitable and<BR>
environmentally safe process converts into clean, &quot;green&quot;<BR>
electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid Waste,<BR>
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes,<BR>
industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural<BR>
gas, and the huge market of used tires.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity<BR>
from the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is<BR>
then sold to replenish the local or national grid.<BR>
<BR>
The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide<BR>
need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a<BR>
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the<BR>
disposal of waste. GEEC has secured international acceptance<BR>
for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact<BR>
the global waste problem while a major push for generating<BR>
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot<BR>
topic due to shortages and massive power failures.<BR>
<BR>
GEEC just announced a $10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with<BR>
Chinese Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coal<BR>
Mining (NYSE - YZC, $74). The deal is structured to have 1,300<BR>
GEEC Biosphere Systems deployed throughout China to fulfill<BR>
an urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation, two<BR>
critical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1.3<BR>
billion people. As China's rapid economic advance continues,<BR>
a shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually, prompting<BR>
periodic blackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line<BR>
to profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable<BR>
Municpal Solid Waste disposal and simultaneously helping China<BR>
meet its energy needs.<BR>
<BR>
The forecast for GEEC is crystal clear, and this is just the tip<BR>
of the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares<BR>
should be added immediately to every portfolio. We expect a<BR>
continuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still<BR>
represent an uncommon value for a Company of this caliber. Look<BR>
for the continuation of strong positive developments that will<BR>
ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for the most<BR>
explosive gains on Wall Street.<BR>
