Wall Street Money  Report  discovers  leading edge Entertainment Company
preparing for blockbuster new release! KDSC positioned as the  #1  stock
investment in children's entertainment for years to come.

Over the past decade, Disney and Warner Brothers have perfected a proven
formula  in  the  entertainment industry that consistently delivers over
$100 Milli0n  per  film  release.  Box  office  results  have shown that
animated features and  movies  geared  toward  a  younger  audience  are
genuine  profit  makers  with  movie-goers  starved  for quality G-rated
family entertainment.

By  enhancing  this  model  for  success,  KidSational,  Inc.  (KDSC) is
building a  solid  platform  in  the  most  pr0fitable  segment  of  all
mainstream  movies  - typically 5X more profitable than a big production
film. Through skillful  management  and  product  depth, KDSC is rapidly
becoming a diversified entertainment empire, poised to become one of the
leaders in this industry.

Fueled by recent positive developments and  the  revenue  power  of  its
product  line,  KidSational  is  on  track during the month of August to
finalize negotiations with leading Hollywood producers and executives to
bring "The Guardians" movie to  the  Big  Screen. KDSC is moving forward
with lightning speed as evidenced by their developing relationships with
specialists in entertainment law and top music tour  management,  motion
picture   producers,  executive  producers  and  distributors,  and  the
selection of product placement and marketing experts.

             

KDSC's initial motion picture  is  entitled  "The Guardians - Masters of
the Electro-World", based on adolescent super heroes along the lines  of
Mighty  Morphin Power Rangers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, who have
collectively  produced  revenues  exceeding   $500  Milli0n.  One  clear
advantage for KDSC is that "The Guardians" is scheduled  to  feature  TV
and  movie  industry  stars,  giving  the  film that extra boost of mass
appeal. KDSC's theater release is based upon the theme and characters in
the nationally available  Guardian's  board  game  (100%  owned by KDSC)
which is used in over 400 elementary schools and has been featured on  a
major nationally syndicated afternoon TV talk show.

Judging  by the numbers, major full length films of this type that reach
out not just to kids but  entire  families, have enjoyed huge box office
success. This is based on a release of over 1,000 screens, right in line
with Company expectations for their premier in just the  US  alone.  But
the  box  office revenues are only a fraction of the huge income that is
typically realized  from  a  film.  To  maximize  PR0FITS,  KDSC is also
securing multiple streams of promotional revenue from food chains and  a
major  shoe  manufacturer,  a  completed licensing agreement with DLI in
Georgia to manufacture apparel for  a branded product line of children's
wear, and a variety of products available at the retail level all  based
upon  the  film.  Everything  from  action  figures,  clothing, toys, to
children's party  favors  and  lunch  boxes  are  scheduled for national
merchandising in order to extend the brand and generate revenue.

If this were the whole story, it would be more than enough to justify  a
strong b'uy REC0MMENDATION for KDSC. However, this isn't even the tip of
the iceberg. The really big income  will most likely be in VCR/DVD sales
after the movie has run in theaters. Anyone who has  small  children  or
grandchildren  knows that the VCR/DVD is today's electronic baby sitter.
Children watch films over and  over  again  memorizing all the songs and
story lines. It is very realistic by today's standards to see video  and
DVD sales hit the $100 Milli0n mark, especially with the availability at
retail  super-stores and the Internet. One of the most magnificent facts
about children's movies is that a  new  generation is born every 7 years
to enjoy re-releases as well as home video.

               


KDSC's Music Division is red-hot,  featuring  the  new  urban/pop  music
sensation  "TGK".  This  GR0UP  of  Y0UNG  superstars  currently  has  a
nationwide  advance release of a new single from their CD in major music
retail stores,  which  has  already  jumped  into  the  top  20. KDSC is
enjoying the ultimate in cross-over entertainment success  by  featuring
the music of TGK in the soundtrack for The Guardians movie. TGK has been
receiving  major  radio airplay while performing worldwide, and promotes
only a positive message with no negative lyrics in their music.

KDSC has cemented  partnerships  that  will  enhance their entertainment
products,in-crease distribution channels, and accelerate growth. Dynamic
PR0FITS are  realized  in  the  early  growth  stages  of  a  burgeoning
entertainment  company  that has nailed the blueprint for success. Savvy
investors with an eye for value  can benefit from the tremendous PR0FITS
that will launch  the  f0rtunes  of  this  new  film  and  entertainment
powerhouse.
