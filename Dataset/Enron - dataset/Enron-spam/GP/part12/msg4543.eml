Major Breaking News: CDYV Expands Publication into the<BR>
Dallas/Ft.Worth, Texas Metroplex Area Resulting in<BR>
Circulation of 3 Million Copies Monthly. Revenues to<BR>
Exceed 30 Mill Annually with nearly<BR>
15 Mill Bottom-Line Profit.<BR>
<BR>
CDYV positioned as likely takeover candidate by the<BR>
always acquisition-minded leaders of the publishing<BR>
industry capturing sales of 20 Billion.<BR>
<BR>
CDYV is the leading advertising, printing, and publishing<BR>
Company in Texas specializing in the very high-profit<BR>
sector of community-based weekly publications. As Master<BR>
Publisher for the State of Texas, CDYV reaches 22 million<BR>
people, 254 counties, and over 3,100 towns and cities<BR>
with their &quot;Tidbits&quot; publication featuring local<BR>
advertising in dozens of areas including entertainment,<BR>
real estate/housing, consumer goods and services, and<BR>
major retailers like Walgreens and Dollar General.<BR>
<BR>
CDYV has been in business 4 years and has grown quickly,<BR>
now it is time for them to explode in the public markets.<BR>
CDYV is new to the stock market, having gone public in a<BR>
very quiet manner. So you have a very brief period to<BR>
get in at or near the bottom before share prices soar on<BR>
increased investor awareness. There are very few companies<BR>
that have perfected this niche of advertising platform<BR>
with none being publicly offered starting out at less than<BR>
50 cents per share.<BR>
<BR>
Monthly circulation has jumped from 500,000 to 3 million<BR>
with the additional expansion into Dallas/Ft.Worth,<BR>
translating into over 9 million readers monthly and<BR>
achieving an additional 17 million in annual revenues<BR>
from the Metroplex Area alone. CDYV will also provide the<BR>
necessary printing services for 150 other national<BR>
publishers in their respective states resulting in another<BR>
9.5 million in yearly sales, with 50% to the bottom-line,<BR>
on top of their already explosive, record-shattering figures.<BR>
<BR>
The publishing industry has always been an active leader in<BR>
mergers, takeovers, and acquisitions. Dow Jones (DJ, 37.00,<BR>
PE 32), Gannett (GCI, 79.00, PE 16), Knight-Ridder<BR>
(KRI, 65.00, PE 16), and Tribune Co. (TRB, 40.00, PE 24)<BR>
are just a few examples of industry leaders that have spent<BR>
Billions over the last few years acquiring aggressive and<BR>
profitable newspaper chains and publishing companies. CDYV<BR>
represents the epitome of an attractive buyout target as<BR>
their PE is 1 based on 12 - 18 month sales and earnings<BR>
figures. The industry average PE is 20, indicating that a<BR>
share price of 5.00 for CDYV would be a very conservative<BR>
valuation.<BR>
<BR>
