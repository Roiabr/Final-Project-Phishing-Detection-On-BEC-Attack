<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear friend,<BR>
<BR>
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the<BR>
fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I<BR>
have no intentions of causing you any pains. As you<BR>
read this, I do not want you to feel sorry for me,<BR>
because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name<BR>
is Larry Moore, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I<BR>
have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal<BR>
cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity<BR>
in caring for my health. It has defied all form of<BR>
medicine and right now, I have only about a few months<BR>
to live according to medical experts.<BR>
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I<BR>
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my<BR>
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,<BR>
I was always hostile to people and only focus on my<BR>
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But<BR>
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more<BR>
to life than just wanting to have or make all the<BR>
money in the world. I believe when God gives me a<BR>
second chance to come to this world I would live my<BR>
life a different way from how I have lived it. Now<BR>
that I know my time is near, I have willed and given<BR>
most of my properties and assets to my immediate and<BR>
extended family members and as well as a few close<BR>
friends.<BR>
I have decided to give alms to charity organizations,<BR>
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do<BR>
on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some<BR>
charity organizations in the U.A.E, London and<BR>
Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly,<BR>
I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked<BR>
members of my family to close one of my accounts and<BR>
donate the money, which I have there to charity<BR>
organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the<BR>
money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them<BR>
anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I<BR>
have left for them. The last of my money which is the<BR>
huge cash deposit that I have with security firm<BR>
Abroad .I will want you to help me collect this<BR>
deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations and<BR>
let them know that it is I Larry Moore that is making<BR>
this generous donation. I am writing this from my<BR>
laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my<BR>
time to come. I pray that God uses you to support and<BR>
assist me with good heart.<BR>
God be with you,<BR>
Larry Moore.<BR>
