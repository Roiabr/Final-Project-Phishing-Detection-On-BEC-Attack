<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>A very good day to you<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr. Jonathan Mwari Zuma, an accountant and principal overseer<BR>
with the South African Mining Corporation. I got your contact =
through<BR>
my local chamber of commerce with the help of a friend in line with<BR>
the search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very<BR>
confidential transaction, which involves transfer of&nbsp; fund to a<BR>
foreign account. This said fund (US$20.5m) Twenty million, five<BR>
hundred thousand United States dollars, is a variation and<BR>
accumulation of equity investment made in the South African Mining<BR>
corporation in the period of 1983-1987. This redeemable investment<BR>
interest, has now matured and has long been cleared for disbursement<BR>
but with no apparent knowledge of who the investors are as most of =
the<BR>
investors then, were corrupt government officials and their cronies<BR>
under the obnoxious apartheid regime who used pseudo names and =
aliases<BR>
in the transactions, and could not come up for claims under the<BR>
present political setting in South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
After due consultative sessions with my colleagues in the account<BR>
department of the mining corporation over the fund (US$20.5M), which<BR>
is now considered as floating fund, we decided to confiscate the =
fund<BR>
and placed it in a private trust company for safe keeping, awaiting<BR>
further transfer to a foreign account for further business ventures.<BR>
What we need now is a foreign national who can assist us in the<BR>
transfer of this fund, and also to help invest the fund in a risk =
free<BR>
venture. if you are willing to assist us in this transfer, we have<BR>
agreed to compensate you with a certain percentage(15%) of the total<BR>
sum (US$20.5m) through mutual negotiations. Your specialty is not a<BR>
barrier to this transaction as we have mapped out strategies to<BR>
effectively actualize this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your anticipated co-operation, and we hope to hear =
from<BR>
you soon ,to enable us give you full details of the transactions.<BR>
Alternatively, you can reply using this email below<BR>
On the contrary, do let me know that you can not transact this<BR>
business.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards<BR>
<BR>
