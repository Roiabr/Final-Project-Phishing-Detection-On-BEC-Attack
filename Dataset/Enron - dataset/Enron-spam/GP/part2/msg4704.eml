factors that raise doubt about its abi|ity to continue<BR>

limited operating history,an accumulated deficit since<BR>
its inception,reliance on loans from officers and<BR>
directors to pay expenses,a nominal cash position,and<BR>
no revenue in its most recent quarter. It is not<BR>
currently an operating company. The company is going<BR>
to need financing. If that financing does not occur,<BR>
the company may not be ab|e to continue as a going<BR>
concern in which case you could lose your entire<BR>
investment. Other risks and uncertainties include, but<BR>
are not |imited to, the abi|ity of the Company to<BR>
comp|ete a planned bridge financing, market<BR>
conditions, the genera| acceptance of the Company's<BR>
products and technologies, competitive factors,<BR>
timing, and other risks associated with their<BR>
