<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Friend.<BR>
<BR>
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I =
believe<BR>
everyone will die someday.<BR>
<BR>
My name is Shadak Shari, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have =
been<BR>
diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of =
medical<BR>
treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, =
according<BR>
to medical experts.<BR>
<BR>
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared =
for<BR>
anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was =
never<BR>
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business =
as<BR>
that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now =
know<BR>
that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the =
money<BR>
in the world.<BR>
<BR>
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I =
would<BR>
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God =
has<BR>
called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to =
my<BR>
immediate and extended family members as well as a few close =
friends.<BR>
<BR>
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided =
to<BR>
give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the =
last<BR>
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some =
charity<BR>
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health =
has<BR>
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.<BR>
<BR>
I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and =
distribute<BR>
the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and<BR>
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do =
not<BR>
trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have =
left<BR>
for them.<BR>
<BR>
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of =
seven<BR>
million dollars $7,000,000,that I have with a<BR>
finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect =
this<BR>
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.<BR>
<BR>
I have set aside 10% for you for your time and patience.please send a =
reply<BR>
through this email address(shadakshari002@telkom.net) with your full =
contact<BR>
information for more private and confidential<BR>
communication.<BR>
<BR>
God be with you.<BR>
