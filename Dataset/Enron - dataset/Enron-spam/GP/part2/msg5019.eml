Hi Varou,=20
<p>
Taking the impotence drug with alcohol and food. Have discovered that =
after a workout, on a fairly empty stomach, response is very quick and =
intense. Taken with meals really causes a lag for me. - Bob, Age 45
<p>
Gone forever are the headaches, hassles and high costs of obtaining the =
pharmacy products you want and need.
<p>
We don't require any prescriptions.. <a =
