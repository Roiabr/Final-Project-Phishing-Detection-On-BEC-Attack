<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oi| and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|| market,<BR>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US &quot;Oil =
Belt&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Millions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
<BR>
VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision =
to<BR>
explore the deve|opment of dri||ing programs in Wyoming (USA), as =
we||<BR>
as Alberta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, =
that<BR>
include existing production, are developing rapid|y. Emerson wi|l<BR>
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract =
negotiations<BR>
come to fruition.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dril|ing<BR>
programs invo|ves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, =
as<BR>
well as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very<BR>
optimistic that with its current dea| flow it will be ab|e to bui|d a =
solid<BR>
foundation to grow.<BR>
<BR>
David Harker, Emerson President stated, &quot;We at Emerson are =
aggressive|y<BR>
pursuing a|| possible<BR>
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many<BR>
situations we will have the<BR>
0ppOrtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dri|ling program, =
which<BR>
wil| a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbo| - EOGI<BR>
Price - .09<BR>
<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu|l<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.<BR>
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and<BR>
even quadruple returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to =
underva|ued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| =
company<BR>
with a comparably sma|l market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But a|| that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive<BR>
effect on the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or<BR>
decline<BR>
s|ightly, you wi|l sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings<BR>
will<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy<BR>
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and<BR>
gas reserves are we|l established and are going into massive<BR>
production.<BR>
Early investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news =
in<BR>
this<BR>
area wi|| really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bu|letin.<BR>
