<BR>
Sir,<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of my writing to you is because I am searching for a foreign =
business partner who is in a position to assist me with my urgent =
business proposal, as time is not on my side. A partner, who understands =
what confidentiality, means and who has the necessary facilities I =
require in embarking on this important venture. I decided to contact you =
through email as it is the only means I consider safe to contact you. I =
apologize if this is not acceptable to you.<BR>
<BR>
We want to transfer to abroad $US12.8m (Twelve Million Eight Hundred =
Thousand United States Dollars) from A Security Company, Sovereign Trust =
&amp; Securities Corp Spain Branch, situated in the above location in =
Spain. I am contacting you in a non official capacity.<BR>
<BR>
I am Anthonio Rodrigo, Accountant, Sovereign Trust Corporation, Espana. =
During the Course of Our Auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an =
account opened in the security Company in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has =
operated on this account again.&nbsp; After going through some old files =
in the records, I discovered that the owner of the account died without =
an [Heir], Hence the money has been floating and if I do not remit this =
money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.<BR>
<BR>
The owner of this account was Mr. Michael D. Owen, a foreigner, and an =
Industrialist, he died since 1993 and no other person knows about this =
account or anything concerning it. The account has no beneficiary and my =
investigation proved to me as well that Mr. Michael D. Owen until his =
death was the Managing Director, Sabadell Miangol, GMBH,<BR>
<BR>
I am contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be =
approved to a foreigner with a valid International Passport, Drivers =
License and foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the =
former owner of the account Mr. Michael D. Owen is a foreigner.&nbsp; I =
am revealing all this to you with the belief that you will never let me =
down in this business. For your active participation, I have two options =
of payment for you. Firstly you can choose to have 20% of the money for =
your assistance or you can go into partnership with me for the proper =
and profitable investment of the entire money in your country. Of =
course, the investment must be under your direct management and =
supervision. As soon as the money has been transferred into your =
account, I shall come to your country and meet you face to face to work =
out the modalities of the investments.<BR>
<BR>
Please notify me of your choice in your reply.<BR>
<BR>
I have also set aside 5% of the total sum $12.8M for all kinds of =
expenses that may come our way in the process of this transaction. =
Please note that this 5% for expenses is not with me at the moment but =
shall be deducted from the money as soon as you have received it in your =
account.<BR>
<BR>
Be informed that this transaction is risk free as all modalities have =
been put in place for a hitch free transaction.<BR>
<BR>
To commence this transaction, I require you to immediately indicate your =
interest by a return e-mail to the above address or my private e-mail: =
anthonio_rodrigo01@gawab.com and enclose your private contact telephone =
number, fax number, full name and address. Note also, that this =
transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its =
nature.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>
