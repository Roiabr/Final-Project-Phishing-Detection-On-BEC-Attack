In England nobody under the age of 18 is allowed to drink in a =
public<BR>
bar.Mr. Thompson used to go to a bar near his house quite often, but =
he<BR>
never took his son, Tom, because he was too young. Then when Tom had =
his<BR>
eighteenth birthday, Mr. Thompson took him to his usual bar for the =
first<BR>
time. They drank for half an hour, and then Mr. Thompson said to his =
son,<BR>
&quot;Now, Tom, I want to teach you a useful lesson. You must always be =
careful<BR>
not to drink too much. And how you know when you've had enough? Well, =
I'll<BR>
tell you. Do you see those two lights at the end of the bar? When they =
seem<BR>
to have become four, you've had enough and should go =
home.&quot;&quot;But , Dad,&quot; said<BR>
Tom, &quot; I can only see one light at the end of the bar&quot;.<BR>
The LAPD, The FBI, and the CIA are all trying to prove that they are =
the<BR>
best at apprehending criminals. The President decides to give them a =
test.<BR>
He releases a rabbit into afforest and has each of them try to catch it. =
The<BR>
CIA goes in. They place animal informants throughout the forest. =
They<BR>
question all plant and mineral witnesses. After three months of =
extensive<BR>
investigations they conclude that rabbits do not exist. Then the FBI =
goes<BR>
in. After two weeks with no leads they burn the forest, filling =
everything<BR>
in it, including the rabbit, and they make no apologies. The rabbit had =
it<BR>
coming. Then the LAPD goes in. They come out two hours later with a =
badly<BR>
beaten raccoon. The raccoon is yelling: &quot;Okay! Okay! I!/m a rabbit! =
I'm a<BR>
rabbit!&quot;<BR>
