<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Mr Morris Zihillr<BR>
Accra Ghana,<BR>
West African Region.<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr Morris Zihillr, Chairman Contract Awarding and Tender Committee =
of African Union (AU), Sub- Head Accra Ghana. Forgive my contact because =
this letter comes to you as a surprise, as you don't know of it's coming =
before. My contact is for you to please assist in the transfer of =
Fifty-Eight Million, Four Hundred Thousand ($58,400,000.00) to any safe =
account of your choice in your country, be it personal or company's =
account. This money was gotten from over invoices I and two of my =
colleagues, account and secretary of the above mentioned department =
prepared from the original contracts bills the committee awarded to =
contractors who supplied foods, hard and softwares, pharmaceutical and =
medical equipments to the peacekeeping mission troop in Liberia, =
Sierra-Leone, Somalia and Cote'd Vore civil wars.<BR>
<BR>
All lope holes leading to its removal were sealed off with legal =
documents attached to the original invoices. Because of the political =
instability in some of the African countries and the law guiding our =
service to African Union, which prevents we civil servants from =
operating foreign account, we were unable to carry out this transfer =
since a while. This unhealthy situation forced us to deposit the money =
with a security company in Accra Ghana as &quot;African Gold&quot;, for =
a long time now, awaiting a foreign person/company we will present as =
the owner for collection of the money. Now that political instability in =
Africa has changed though our right to operate foreign account has not =
been given to us and we now are getting close to our retirements, we =
decided to seek your mutual partnership into this huge money transfer =
project.<BR>
<BR>
But before we do this, we need to arrange for seeing ourselves face to =
face to discuss heartily then commence and conclude this transfer. It =
was our general wish to seek for your assistance to provide us with the =
facilities to transfer this money out of Africa and we solely belief you =
will assist in transferring this money to your position successfully. To =
make this transaction a success, all the legal documents backing the =
transfer of this $58,400,000-00 out of Africa to your place of choice is =
made ready and will be sent to you as quickly as we receive your =
acceptance to assist. It was this ethnic law preventing we civil =
servants from operating foreign account, made us to need your assistance =
as a foreigner to enable us get this money shifted to any account of =
your choice in your country.<BR>
<BR>
Bearing in mind that your assistance is highly needed, we have decided =
to give you 20% of the total money at the end of this transaction as =
your share for assisting, 5% is kept aside for expenses while 75% will =
be for me and my colleagues. The project is expected to be successfully =
completed if you give us the total cooperation needed from your side. =
For security of this money, you and us, we expect your confidentiality =
and utmost secrecy in this transfer. The confidentiality this transfer =
will get from both sides through out the transferring process and =
successful conclusion of this transaction will make us retire peacefully =
and live to establish businesses that will brighten the entire lives of =
our families in future. There is no risk involved. Contact me upon the =
receipt of this mail through my email for more details on the =
procedure.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
