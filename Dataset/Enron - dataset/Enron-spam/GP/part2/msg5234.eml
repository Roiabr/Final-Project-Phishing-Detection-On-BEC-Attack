<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>For The Attention of: OWNER / CHIEF EXECUTIVE<BR>
<BR>
This is for your urgent attention.&nbsp; First, I must solicit your<BR>
strictest confidence as you read this letter.&nbsp; Though this might =
come<BR>
to you as a surprise since we have not met or spoken with each other<BR>
before.&nbsp; I plead for your understanding and tender my humble<BR>
apologies if I had taken you unaware.<BR>
<BR>
My name is Dr.ADAMS&nbsp; OWELLE, a member of the committee set up by =
the<BR>
Federal Government of Nigeria to supervise the activities of the<BR>
Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), the agency that manages proceeds from =
the<BR>
sale of crude oil in my country.&nbsp; At the inception of the new<BR>
democratic government in my country, the Petroleum Trust Fund was<BR>
ordered to wind up its operation to enable the new committee take<BR>
over.&nbsp; The former Chairman of the agency in the person of Major<BR>
General Muhammed Buhari (Rtd.) was also retired.<BR>
<BR>
In its place a new committee in which I am a member was appointed to<BR>
take over and oversee the activities of the agency. The duty of the<BR>
committee amongst others includes verifying all outstanding contract<BR>
claims and debts with the sole objective of settling such long<BR>
overdue claims.&nbsp; I therefore decided to contact you directly =
having<BR>
gotten your name and company's information from a business handbook<BR>
of your country I discovered in the former chairman=12s official =
study,<BR>
which he left behind in his office.<BR>
<BR>
Going through some of the files left behind by the former chairman,<BR>
we discovered that he has secured out of the Central Bank of Nigeria<BR>
a forex release to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 for the payment of<BR>
goods and services supplied by foreign contractors for the execution<BR>
of KUBUWA WATER PROJECT in the oil rich Niger Delta.&nbsp; He was =
trying<BR>
to transfer the funds to a ghost company abroad when he was removed<BR>
from office.&nbsp; In confidence, we know that the goods and services =
were<BR>
not supplied but used his office to approve the payment in favour of<BR>
a foreign firm with no fixed address.&nbsp; He confided in me as a =
member<BR>
of the new committee that he used his position to over invoice the<BR>
contract.&nbsp; After his removal from office, this over invoiced =
amount<BR>
is floating in the system and left unclaimed.&nbsp; He has therefore<BR>
requested me to help look for a foreign company into whose account<BR>
the funds will be transferred.<BR>
<BR>
I am now soliciting for your cooperation to enable us process the<BR>
transfer of the funds to your account. You should provide us your<BR>
company's name or any other name as long as you will be able to<BR>
receive the amount.&nbsp; It will be treated as one of the =
outstanding<BR>
payments due to you on executed contract.&nbsp; We will take measure =
to<BR>
duly register your company here in Nigeria to give it legitimacy.&nbsp; =
We<BR>
need your company's name and account particulars to enable us file<BR>
application for foreign exchange allocation order at the Federal<BR>
Ministry of Finance.&nbsp; The moment we accomplish this, we will =
raise<BR>
Contract Award Certificate in your company's name to show that a<BR>
contract was actually awarded and executed by you. The nature of =
your<BR>
business does not matter.<BR>
<BR>
For your participation and investing in this project, we are =
prepared<BR>
to concede 25%of the total sum to you.&nbsp; On completion of the =
project,<BR>
we will commit a substantial percentage of our share into =
investments<BR>
in your country and we will direct you on how to repatriate the<BR>
balance of our share.<BR>
<BR>
I wish to state here again that confidentiality should be our<BR>
watchword. If the above proposal meets your approval, please respond<BR>
immediately.<BR>
<BR>
Endeavour to furnish me with your secured private telephone and fax<BR>
line for easy reach.<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
