FAMILY BUSINESS INVESTMENT<BR>
Dear ......,<BR>
This letter might surprise you because we have not met neither in =
person<BR>
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to =
know<BR>
somebody either in physical or through correspondence. I got your =
contact<BR>
through some discreet inquiry from the chamber of commerce and industry, =
you<BR>
and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private<BR>
entrepreneurship, one has no doubt in your ability to handle a financial =
business<BR>
transaction. However, I wish to introduce myself, I am&nbsp; Johnson =
Kabila the son of the<BR>
late Democratic Republic of Congo President Laurent Desire Kabila of =
the<BR>
blessed memory. I know this letter might come to you as a surprise but =
I<BR>
honestly do not intend to surprise you. I write this letter in respect =
of my<BR>
intention to invest the sum of US$28M (Twenty-Eight Million United State =
Dollars)<BR>
with you. I inherited this money from my mother. This money was got =
through<BR>
the smuggling and sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the head =
of<BR>
state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position =
to<BR>
engage in the business of Diamond and Timber since she knows that her =
survival<BR>
will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation. When =
my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards<BR>
Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers =
that wanted<BR>
to topple him I escaped to South Africa because of the fear that I =
might<BR>
be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present =
head<BR>
of state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of<BR>
relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and =
this<BR>
ultimately affected us their children. Considering the relationship =
between South Africa and the Democratic<BR>
Republic of Congo new government, my mother advised me to leave For =
South Africa<BR>
for security reason, while the funds were deposited with a Security =
Company<BR>
in Madrid Spain. On getting to South Africa where I have been living =
since then as a<BR>
political refugee I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist =
me in<BR>
moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment. =
Honestly I<BR>
contacted you because I don't want to invest this money in South Africa =
due to my<BR>
status here as a political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to take =
risk<BR>
because this money is all that I and my Mother is depending on because =
My half<BR>
brother has seized all my father's assets and money and left I and my =
mother<BR>
empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the =
Security<BR>
Company in Madrid Spain so that is why I decided that investing this =
money<BR>
abroad should be the best investment for me. I will be honored if I can =
be<BR>
given the privilege of investing this money with your help. In view of =
this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough<BR>
to respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a =
hopeless<BR>
future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and =
candid<BR>
effort in this regard with 20% of the total money and annual 5% of the =
after<BR>
tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, the =
term<BR>
shall be varied. 5% for expenses, which may arise during the =
transaction, fax<BR>
and phone bills inclusive.$28million US Dollars. when the money<BR>
($28million) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to =
draw 20%<BR>
your favor, while the remaining 75% will be invested meaningfully for =
our<BR>
future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of =
the<BR>
Economy in your country which are dividends yielding. Whatever your =
decision is please reach me immediately through my private<BR>
phone or Email, and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of =
my<BR>
family. Best Regards,<BR>
Johnson Kabila (for the family)<BR>
