<br><br>It is hard to feel individually responsible with respect to the =
invisible processes of a huge and distant government.

<br>Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.



<br>Failure -- The man who can tell others what to do and how to do it, =
but never does it himself.

it hard, and putting off a hard one makes it impossible.


<br>Whenever nature leaves a hole in a person's mind, she generally =
plasters it over with a thick coat of self-conceit.
