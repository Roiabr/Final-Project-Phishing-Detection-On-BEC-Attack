sometimes, trying to play God.



The terrifying and edible beauty of Art Nouveau architecture.

<br>Love, all alike, no season knows, nor clime, nor hours, days, =
months, which are the rags of time.<BR><BR>Two great European narcotics, =
alcohol and Christianity.


There is no greater treasure than the respect and love of a true friend.



<br>There lives more faith in honest doubt, Believe me, than in half the =
creeds.
<br><br>Divorce is the one human tragedy that reduces everything to =
cash.<br><br>Don't approach a goat from the front, a horse from the =
back, or a fool from any side.
<BR><BR>Every beginning is a consequence. Every beginning ends =
something.

<br>Nothing that you have not given away will ever be really yours.



If your knees are knocking, kneel on them.<br><br>Our fate, whatever it =
is to be, will be overcome by patience under it.
<BR>My conscience aches but it's going to lose the fight.



People who enjoy what they are doing invariably do it well.


<br><br>Faith is trust in what the spirit learned eons ago.<br><br>I =
will fight for my children on any level so they can reach their =
potential as human beings and in their public duties.<br><br>What ever =
beauty may be, it has for its basis order, and for its essence unity.



<br>Friendship is like vitamins, we supplement each other's minimum =
daily requirements
