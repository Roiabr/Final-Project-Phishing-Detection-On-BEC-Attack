<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear My Friend In Christ.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;As you read this,I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I =
believe everyone will die someday.<BR>
<BR>
My name is Cletus Guase, a merchant in Cote D'Ivoire.I have been =
diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer which was discovered very late,due to =
my laxity in caring for my health. The truth of the matter is I could =
die at any time if not for the defibrillator to shock my heart back =
up.It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about =
a few months to live,according to medical experts.<BR>
<BR>
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as never&nbsp; really =
cared for anyone not even myself but my business.Though I am very rich, =
I was never generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on =
my business as that was the only thing i cared for.But now I regret all =
these as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have =
or make all the money in the world.<BR>
<BR>
I believe when gives me a second chance to come to this world I would =
live my life in a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God =
has called me,I have willed and given most of my properties and =
assets<BR>
to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close =
friends.<BR>
<BR>
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so,I have decided =
to give arms to charity organizations and give succour and comfort to =
the less priviledged in our societies,as I want this to be one of the =
last good deeds I will do on earth.So far, I have dedicated the money to =
some charity organizations in the Cote D'Ivoire, Algeria and Malaysia. =
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this my self =
anymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts =
and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and =
to the less priviledged in Bulgaria and,they refused and kept the money =
to themselves. Hence,I do not trust them<BR>
anymore, as they seem not to satisfied with what I have left for =
them.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash =
deposit of Three million dollars that I have with a security Company in =
Accra Ghana for safe keeping. I will want you to help me collect =
this<BR>
deposit and disburse it to some charity organizations<BR>
and to the less priviledged.<BR>
<BR>
What do you do with my donation?COI recycle them if you can.With this =
fund,you can buy enough clothing,you'll be providing all new =
clothes,<BR>
food,fresh water, health care, and educational assistance to children on =
a long-term ongoing care.<BR>
<BR>
Please send me a mail to indicate if you will assist me in this =
disbursement.I have set aside 10% for you for your time.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks in Anticipation.<BR>
<BR>
Brother Cletus Guase.<BR>
