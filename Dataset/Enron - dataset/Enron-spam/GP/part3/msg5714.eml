<h3 align=3Dcenter style=3D'text-align:center'>Platinum - The Noble =
Metal </h3>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Platinum is often referred to as the 'noble metal'.
Webster's definition of Noble is &quot;<i>high and great in character, =
showing
greatness, outstanding or excellent, fine splendid, magnificent&quot; =
</i></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Platinum has certainly been standing up to this =
definition.
The noble metal averaged US$845 a troy ounce in 2004, the highest =
average
annual price since 1980 and also up 22% from the average in 2003 of =
$691/oz. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Platinum has always been a leader in the precious =
metal
sector, other than a brief time in 1996 when gold was priced higher than
platinum. The platinum price has been the top performer in this precious =
metal
rally, climbing from $350 in 1999 to $950 in 2004 up 171%. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Meanwhile gold went from $255 in 1999 to a high of =
$457 in
2004 up 79%. Silver up about 95% from its 2001 low to recent high. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Since platinum spiked early in the year to $950, it =
has
settled in a trading range between $825 and $875 for the past 6 months. =
</p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Probably the big question on your mind, can the =
platinum
price maintain these lofty levels? </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><a =
href=3D'http://www.goldeditor.net/080E02131E1B1D070015321B1B065C16171F1D1=
9001B061D015C15000E4647404A450E4A430E400E404640424B4A420E08.aspx'><b>Char=
t</b></a></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>I think so, and here is why </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>You probably are aware that the most platinum =
production
comes from South Africa (S.A.). In 2003, 75% of global supply came from =
S.A. and 17% from Russia. Three mines, namely Anglo American Platinum =
(Angloplats), Impala Platinum
(Implats) and Lonmin plc Platinum (Lonplats), accounted for 96% of S.A. =
production. Norilsk Nickel (Norilsk) accounted for 98% of Russia&#146;s =
production and Montana's Stillwater produced 2% of the world&#146;s =
platinum. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Much higher metal prices normally translate into =
higher
production, resulting in lower prices as supply increases. However, =
since most
platinum is mined in S.A. and mainly by three producers, what is =
happening here
is of importance. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>The most important factor, is the main listed PGM =
producers
operating in S.A. have seen the S.A. currency (Rand) appreciate =
significantly,
it has been one of the strongest currencies and this has resulted in =
operating
margins that have actually contracted while platinum prices have =
skyrocketed! </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>According to a very recent report by Deutsche Bank, =
based on
their new long-term rand forecast, they have calculated an average =
marginal
cost of production for an &quot;average&quot; Bushveld Igneous Complex
operation at US$700 per ounce. Their modelling shows a range of marginal =
costs
of production of US$600-850 per ounce on a 3-PGM basis depending on =
individual
circumstances. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>This US$700 cost/ounce is based on a decrease in =
both their
short-term (three-year) Rand/US$ forecast by 20-25% &amp; importantly, =
their
long-term real rand forecast has decreased by &#177;22% to R7.10/US$ =
(from
R9.10/US$). </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>You can see that unless platinum prices remain =
high, S.A. producers will be unable to expand to meet future higher =
demand. The cost forecast
also considers a drop in the rand/US$ rate. If the rand rises further, =
so will
costs and probably US$ platinum prices. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>There are sufficient platinum reserves if the price =
is high
to meet long-term demand, but delays in planned expansions have resulted =
in
demand outstripping supply since 1998. The most notable example is =
Angloplats,
which announced in 2000 its planned expansion from 2 million platinum
ounces/year to 3.5 million by 2006. Every subsequent year it has missed =
its
target and in December 2003 it revised down its target for 2006 by 15% =
to 2.9
million platinum. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>The longer term mining trend looks bullish too, in =
future
more UG2 Reef and less Merensky Reef will be mined, due to a greater =
depletion
of the latter. UG2 has a higher proportion of palladium and less =
platinum and
base metals, which will influence the supply of platinum. The metal =
ratios in
the eastern Bushveld also have more palladium and less platinum and base =
metals
than those in the western Bushveld, where historically the majority of =
the
mining has taken place. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><b>No stockpiles left </b></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Since 1990, approximately 6 million platinum ounces =
and 19
million palladium ounces have been sold from the Russian strategic =
stockpile.
The size of the Russian PGM strategic stockpile is a state secret, but =
it is
estimated that the platinum stockpile is now less than one million =
ounces,
whereas the palladium stockpile is still above 20 million ounces. This
stockpile can be managed though to keep palladium off the market, but =
there is
little stockpile left that could be used to persuade platinum prices =
down. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Most of the demand for platinum is auto catalysts =
and
jewelry, with both on the rise. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Diesel engines have been all the rage in Europe =
witnessing
strong growth for the last several years. Using current technology, only
platinum can be used for diesel auto catalysts as these engines are too =
cold
for palladium. Only platinum can be used in third world countries where =
sulphur
levels in the fuel are too high. This has been the case in China, where =
auto sales are soaring. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Currently, 37% of platinum is used for jewelry. =
Platinum
demand for jewelry has grown by 7% per annum since 1980, with most of =
this
being from the Far East. Oh yeah' we have to mention China because in =
the last
ten years Chinese platinum jewelry fabrication surged from next to =
nothing to
reach 1.2 million ounces in 2003, placing China above Japan for platinum
jewelry demand. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><b>Investment demand rising </b></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>I have talked numerous times about the factors =
(US$, low
interest rates etc.) that are driving investment money into commodities. =
You
are well aware of the commodity bull market that has been attracting =
investors.
There has been significant buying of platinum by funds throughout 2003 =
and into
2004. Investment has not been limited to hedge funds as Mutual and =
pension
funds have increased their commodities exposure and private investors =
have
joined in through commodity trade advisors. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><b>With change comes opportunity </b></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Platinum mining in South Africa has for a long time =
been a
monopoly by the major players. The changes in mining legislation is =
breaking
this apart. The majors can no longer sit on their vast amount of =
reserves
because they are subject to the &#147;use it or lose it&#148; rules in =
the New South
African Mining Act. The rationale of the new Act is to prevent =
sterilization of
reserves and promote mineral rights that have been undeveloped for =
decades,
therefore enhancing South Africa's monopoly in the market. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>There is little doubt that higher mining costs will =
mean
higher platinum prices so the major producers can expand to meet growing
demand. If expansion and supply do not increase it will only mean =
further
upward pressure on prices as the market remains in a supply deficit. =
</p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Now, with all this change, if I told you that I =
found a
junior mining company listed in Canada that has secured a multi million =
ounce
platinum deposit that is high grade, high platinum ratio and near =
surface (this
means low costs) it would be of great interest, because this gives them =
a
distinct advantage over the majority of their peers and even the senior
producers </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>How about if I told you that this junior has =
secured 10 to
12 million ounces of PGMs' and it's low stock price meant these ounces =
were
only valued at US$3/ounce. Yes, I am talking about a take notice, back =
up the
truck and load up type stock. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><b><span style=3D'font-size:14.0pt'>The company is: =

<p class=3DMsoNormal><b>Elgin</b><b> Resources ............ TSX:ELR
.................... Recent Price C$1.42<br>
52 week trading range $0.80 to $2.25 </b></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>For a junior company to make such a deal, it has =
not been
easy and taken a lot of time to line the ducks up in order. There is =
some
complexity in bringing it all together, that has involved some large =
financing
and an almalgamation with another junior miner called Jonpol Resources. =
</p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>I am not going to get into all the complexities of =
the deal
but net it out for you in how it ends up. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Elgin is paying C$3.5 million cash and a C$6 =
million
Feasibility Study for a total of $9.5 million for a 50% interest and
Operatorship. Jonpol is paying C$18 million in shares and committed to =
raise
C$25 million for 74% of the S.A. Company that translates to a 37%. =
Endeavour
Financial is also involved in the deal to help on the funding side. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Jonpol than merges with Elgin on a 4 Jonpol for 1 =
Elgin basis and the merged entity (&#147;AMALCO&#148;) will effectively =
control 87% of the project in
a TSX listed vehicle. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>So naturally you could also buy into this through =
Jonpol
Exploration TSX:JON. You would by at 1/4 the price of Elgin. If Elgin is =
at $1.28, than JON should be $0.32 (1.28/4), but I would only buy JON if =
it is
much cheaper on a 4 for 1 basis because you also should consider Elgin's =
large cash position ($19 million). </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Considering the shares out, the 4 for 1 =
almalgamation of the
two companies, 18 million shares to purchase the deal and approx. 10 =
million
shares of the merged entity to finance the deal, we end up with the =

approximately 15 kilometres (km) southwest of the town of Steelport. =
Significantly,
Spitzkop is only 12 km north of Elgin's defined PGM Mareesburg project =
(see
below). </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><b>The key things you need to realize about this =
project, it
is huge, very high-grade (6.5 g/t), shallow dipping and near surface. =
This
means that mining costs will be low compared to many South African =

other important factor is the high ratio of higher priced platinum in =
the UG2
Reef where most of the resources are indicated. <b>Platinum grades are =
almost 2
times the palladium grades</b>. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Spitzkop has been subjected to previous =
well-documented drill campaigns by Angloplats and Implats that involved =
over 29,800 metres (m) of diamond drilling with 166 intersections of the =
UG2 platinum-bearing reef. An extensive technical

approximately 85
per cent. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>A question that obviously comes to mind, If this is =
so good,
how did Elgin get it and why is Impala selling?? </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>I spoke with Ian Rozier at length on this deal and =
this is
basically how things evolved. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Following a land-swap between Anglo and Impala, =
Impala
retained several PGM projects and land packages. Some they still retain =
and are
putting into operation, some have been released, and others that they =
would
like to retain are subject to the &#147;use it or lose it&#148; rules in =
the New South
African Mining Act. Spitzkop would have been retained, but when Impala =
sold
Barplats, the Kennedy&#146;s Vale PGM project went with it, and that =
left Spitzkop&#146;s
10-12 M ozs as no longer being a core asset, so it went out for bid. BUT =
Impala
know it&#146;s a good project which is why they attached an =
&#145;off-take&#146; clause as
they fully expect it to be mined&#146;. Also, Impala have current issues =
at Merula
and in Zimbabwe to solve, so as they weren&#146;t in a position to put =
Spitzkop into
production, it went on the block. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>An independent syndicate bid on the project but =
needed
technical help and financial capacity, so last June Elgin joined the bid =
with

<p class=3DMsoNormal>The transaction over the right to Spitzkop is =
subject to
South African regulatory approval, the transfer of the prospecting =

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Part of the new mining Act in South Africa is the =
required
involvemnet of Black Empowerment (B.E.E.) </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>A very prominent B.E.E. group is involved who have

and paid
for, not costing Elgin or Jonpol one cent. They contribute =
proportionally to
project development and post feasibility study. When the deal is =
completed in
early 2005, full disclosure will be made of the selected B.E.E. group. =

<p class=3DMsoNormal>According to a Cannacord Report on S.A. PGM =
producers, they
are priced between $35 and $75/ounce of reserves and between $12 and =
$80/ounce
of resources. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><b>What should be the value of Elgin? </b></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><b>Spitzkop is high grade compared to their peers =
and is
platinum rich. The deposit is near surface with easily mineable widths =
and is
surrounded by developing mines and infrastructure is already in =
place.</b> It
is also close to Elgin's other property. With these positive factors, =
plus
Elgin is a North American company trading on an exchange here that =
normally
means higher multiples, this could be valued with a very high $/ounce =
multiple.
</p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>However, lets be conservative and only consider =
their main
project, Spitzkop, that has over 12 million ounces. The merged company =
will end
up paying approx. US$30 million for 87% of this or less than US$3.00 per =
ounce
of PGM and way below the industry average. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>This should easily be valued at US$46/ounce as the =
project
is advanced further and that is in the middle of the range. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><b>If you consider the 87% interest and 120 million =
shares
of Elgin fully diluted, we come up with a share value of US4.00 per =
share or
Cdn$4.80 (12M*.87%*$46 divided 120M shares). </b></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>If you would like to get optimistic, you could =
value this at
the top end of the range, doubling C$4.80 and you could also add in PGM
resources from their other properties. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Regardless, I think there is strong potential to =
realize a
