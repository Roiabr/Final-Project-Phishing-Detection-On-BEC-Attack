<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Attn; Sir,<BR>
<BR>
I am Anthony Frank, a member of the presidential taskforce, drafted by =
the<BR>
Federal government of Nigeria, to look into the contract awarded by<BR>
the various ministries of the Federal Government in the following =
parastatals,<BR>
notably, FMT&amp;H, FMT&amp;A, N.N.P.C the presidency and federal<BR>
Capital Territory, from 2000 to date.<BR>
<BR>
During the course of our investigation, we discovered an accumulated =
sum<BR>
of Fifty Million four hundred thousand U.S Dollars(50,400,000,00)<BR>
in the suspense account of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation =
(NNPC)<BR>
in the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N). Upon enquiry, it was<BR>
discovered that the Money came about as a result of over-invoiced =
contract<BR>
value awarded to foreign contractors. The original contract<BR>
value was inflated to the above stated amount by some erring N.N.P.C. =
officials.<BR>
No Nigeria company or Citizen can lay claim to this fund,<BR>
unless by transfer to a foreign bank account. However, by virtue of my =
position<BR>
and the power bestowed on us by the Government, we have agreed<BR>
with the Minster for budget and planning to remit this fund into an =
account<BR>
outside the shores of the country.This amount has been included in the =
Federal<BR>
Government budget for debt<BR>
payment this fiscal year 2003/2004.<BR>
<BR>
To this end we are soliciting for your assistance in all ramifications =
towards<BR>
the realization of our goal. You are also to assist us in<BR>
channeling the fund into a viable economic venture that will be of =
mutual<BR>
benefit to both parties, in terms of establishing a joint<BR>
venture, if you find our proposal suitable. I have been mandated as a =
matter<BR>
of trust by my colleagues to look for a foreign partner into<BR>
whose account we can transfer this sum of U.S$33,600.000.00(Thirty =
three<BR>
million Six Hundred thousand U.S dollars only.)<BR>
Hence, I am writing you this letter, and we belief we will do business =
together<BR>
for our mutual benefit.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;We have agreed to share the fund as follows:<BR>
<BR>
(1) 30% for you (Account Owner)<BR>
<BR>
(2) 60% for us( The Officials involved)<BR>
<BR>
(3) 5% to be used in settling all local and foreign expenses that =
would<BR>
be incurred in the course of this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
(4) 5% for the Minister of Budget and Planning.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;It is from the 60% that we wish to commence the joint venture. =
Please note<BR>
that the transaction is completely safe and guaranteed since the<BR>
law under which we were set up has empowered us to disburse all =
contract<BR>
funds found to be floating in the Central bank of NigeriaRedundant =
Accounts<BR>
from 1995 till date.<BR>
<BR>
You or your company is to act as beneficiary. We shall conclude =
thetransfer<BR>
of the funds within 14 working days from the date of receipt<BR>
of REQUIREMENT:(a)BANK NAME/ ADDRESS (b)ACCOUNT NAME (c)ACCOUNT =
NUMBER<BR>
(d)TEL/FAX/TELEX OF THE BANK. Also include your personal Tel/fax<BR>
numbers for easy communication.<BR>
<BR>
You can reach me through my e-mail box, if you have any question (s) =
or<BR>
clarification you want me to make.<BR>
<BR>
We are to come to your country for the disbursement of the funds =
upon<BR>
confirmation.<BR>
