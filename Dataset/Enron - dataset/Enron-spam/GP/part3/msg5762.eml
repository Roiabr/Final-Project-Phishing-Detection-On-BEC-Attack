<DIV>Dear, Sir/Madam.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We =
want to transfer to overseas the sum of Forty Two Million United States =
Dollars (U.S.$42,000,000.00) from a Bank here in Africa.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask you to kindly look for =
a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide =
either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account =
immediately to receive this money,though an empty bank account could =
serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end =
of this important business trusting in you and believing&nbsp; in God =
that you&nbsp; will never let me down either now or in time to =
come.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Name is <STRONG>Mr. Greg =
Louis</STRONG> I am an external auditor of a local Bank here in South =
Africa.&nbsp; During the course of our auditing,I discovered a floating =
fund&nbsp; in an account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 =
nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old =
files in the records, I discovered that the owner of the account died =
without a =1B$BE)=1B(Beir apparent to the throne=1B$BGI=1B(Bence the =
money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will =
be forfeited for nothing. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The owner of this account who is Mr.Hugo =
Williams,a foreigner and an industrialist died, since 1990,until now no =
other person(s) knows about this account or could give any documentary =
evidence concerning this account. As such this account has no other =
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Hugo Williams =
until his death was the manager&nbsp;Ceylinco Diamond Company,in South =
Africa.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount involved is =
Forty Two Million United States Dollars (U.S.$42,000,000.00)only. I am =
only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be =
approved to a local account, without valid international foreign =
=1B$BE"=1B(Bgreement=1B$B!&=1B(B but could only be approved to any =
foreigner with valid international credentials: passport or drivers =
license and foreign account&nbsp; because this sum is in U.S. dollars =
and the former owner of the account Mr.Hugo Williams is a foreigner too, =
thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, knowing all this, we will reach a =
binding agreement in this regards.As a matter of urgency,I will inform =
you the next step to take, while you Send your private telephone and fax =
number including the full details of the account to be used for the =
deposit.I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a =
binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the =
money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. Before =
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need your full co-operation to make this =
business a success, because the management is ready to approve this =
payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, =
which I will give to you,upon your positive response and once I am =
convinced that you are&nbsp; capable and will meet up with the =
instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in =
this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never&nbsp; =
let me down.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With my influence and the position in the =
bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account =
which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact =
pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prove the authenticity of the business I =
will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for =
onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance =
from the relevant ministries, foreign exchange departments, embassy and =
Board of Internal Revenue services.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the conclusion of this business, you =
will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me,while 5% will =
be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this =
process.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I look forward to your earliest reply through my&nbsp;e-mail =
address or Tel/Fax.<BR>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Yours truly</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
