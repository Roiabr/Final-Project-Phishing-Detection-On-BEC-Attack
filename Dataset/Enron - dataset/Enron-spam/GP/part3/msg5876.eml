<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Citizen,<BR>
<BR>
Permit me to introduce myself, I am George Anthony Miller, accounts =
manager in a leading bank in Europe.In the course of a bi-annual =
&quot;ACCOUNT REVIEW OPERATION&quot; i discovered that an account =
belonging to one Mrs. Fiona Watt, now DECEASED has remained dormant for =
the last two years. After extensive investigations, i found out that the =
Late Mrs. Watt died in a ghastly auto crash in June, 2002.<BR>
<BR>
At this point i am contacting you concerning a carefully thought-out =
plan that necessitates you to act as the beneficiary cum next of kin to =
the said dormant account. I shall provide more technical details on how =
i believe this can be accomplished. The funds in this account, if left =
unclaimed for a stipulated number of years would be declared =
unserviceable,and inherited by the government.Working discreetly with =
me, i believe we can prevent this, and acquire the funds for =
ourselves.<BR>
<BR>
PLEASE,IGNORE THIS LETTER AND RESPECT MY TRUST IN YOU BY NOT EXPOSING =
THIS TRANSACTION, SHOULD YOU NOT BE INTERESTED.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
George A. Miller<BR>
