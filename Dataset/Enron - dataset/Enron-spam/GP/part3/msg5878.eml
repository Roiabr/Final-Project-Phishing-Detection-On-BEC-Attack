<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello friend<BR>
<BR>
&gt;From time immemorial, those who have been inspired to bring change =
have<BR>
all employed one thing in common; innovation, creative tools, and =
most<BR>
importantly through good thinking. I say this in respect of my =
business<BR>
proposal, which I want to execute with you.<BR>
<BR>
I have no doubt in my mind that there will be a complete life turn<BR>
around, by the end of this deal. Once an interest is indicated, the<BR>
necessary documents and information will be supplied<BR>
to you for authentic clarification.<BR>
<BR>
I am barrister Charles Ashford of Ashford chambers, a representative<BR>
and an attorney to JOHN SONNE a business man and CEO<BR>
of SULTA OIL, a registered oil servicing contractor in London,UK.<BR>
whose untimely death occurred recently in his home<BR>
town Iraq following a recent car explosion.<BR>
<BR>
Neither him nor his wife who he used as his next of kin are alive =
since<BR>
the incident claimed the lives of the entire family,leaving no one<BR>
alive to claim the sum of ($14,000,000.00USD), he left in a security =
company.<BR>
<BR>
It is against this backdrop that I seek for a foreign<BR>
partner that we<BR>
can work together to make the transfer of this money a<BR>
success. Reply<BR>
immediately to ashford_chambers@yahoo.co.uk or give me a<BR>
call on: +447040113646,447040113647 if<BR>
you are interested<BR>
Thanks:<BR>
<BR>
Barrister Charles&nbsp; Ashford<BR>
