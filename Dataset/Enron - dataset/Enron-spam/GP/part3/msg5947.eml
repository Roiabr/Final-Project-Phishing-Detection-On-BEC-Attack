There are more checks at the statue.The latter include a device that =
blows air through clothing and tests for evidence of explosive =
particles. The State of Liberty is among the first sites with the =
technology.On September 11, 2001, the second of two hijacked jetliners =
skimmed low over the statue just seconds before crashing into the World =
Trade Center's south tower, 11/2 miles away. The 12 acres of Liberty =
Island were closed to the public for two months after the attacks.Most =
of the 152-foot copper figure was sealed off to visitors and will remain =
so.But visitors may choose between two tours: a walk around the =
promenade atop the star-shaped fort on which the statue stands or an =
elevator ride inside the pedestal to the calf level of the figure, about =
10 stories high, to gaze upward through a glass partition at the steel =
girders and armatures holding it together and view the harbor panorama =
from a narrow observation deck.Also reopened is a museum inside the base =
that details the history of the Statue of Liberty, including such =
artifacts as the original lit-from-within torch, which was replaced =
during a 1986 renovation with a gilded version lit from =
outside.Parkinson said the government &quot;has not foreclosed&quot; the =
idea of eventually reopening the statue's body so visitors could once =
again climb to the crown, but safety factors make that unlikely.<BR>
