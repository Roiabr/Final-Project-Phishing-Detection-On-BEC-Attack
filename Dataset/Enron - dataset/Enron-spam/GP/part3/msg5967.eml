<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hi I'm Julie. Today was a such a sad, sad day for me. =
I was in school today, and what happed was I did not get in, in to the =
cheerleader squad. Its such a shame, but I am trying hard to get over =
this feeling. Next semester I can try out again no biggie. My girl =
friends were so supportive, they are actually at my place, came by for =
few hours to talk girl stuff and drink some cold liquor. If you want to =
join us, come see us on my privet cam. The best thing about it, its =
free. Mwaa, who knows we might even get together some time ;D. =
Byeee.<BR>
