<br><br>A Sunday well-spent brings a week of content.<BR>There's one =
thing about baldness, it's neat.<BR><BR>God is the tangential point =
between zero and infinity.

<br><br>Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one.The more =
corrupt the state, the more laws.


<BR>Honesty is the first chapter of the book of wisdom.<BR><BR>Go for it =
now. The future is promised to no one.
<br><br>Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage, and =
confidence in the doing.



<BR>Myth is neither a lie nor a confession: it is an inflexion.



<br>There is no sweeter sound than the crumbling of ones fellow man.
<br>Some men dream of worthy accomplishments, while others stay awake =
and do them.



<br><br>What is called generosity is usually only the vanity of giving =
we enjoy the vanity more than the thing given.The chief knowledge that a =
man gets from reading books is the knowledge that very few of them are =
worth reading.



Time and trouble will tame an advanced young woman, but an advanced old =
woman is uncontrollable by any earthly force.

<br><br>Then come the wild weather, come sleet or come snow, we will =
stand by each other, however it blow.<br>Creativity is the sudden =
cessation of stupidity.I had a monumental idea this morning, but I =
didn't like it.<BR>Our favorite attitude should be gratitude
