5-3-38-3<BR>
W5M well and are currently drilling at 1,250 feet. Surface casing will =
be run<BR>
to 930 feet. The drilling rig is known as a telescopic double and is =
rated<BR>
to drill to 10,000 feet in depth.&nbsp; Drilling operations are expected =
to<BR>
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a<BR>
restriction on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads =
during<BR>
spring breakup as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is =
an<BR>
annual event, which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when =

site, which will remain there until we are finished drilling, surface =
casing has<BR>
been completed and we will be ready to finish drilling the minute the =
road<BR>
bans are lifted&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a well defined 3-D seismic structural =
high<BR>
within a preserved Pekisko remnant !??island!?L that may have virgin<BR>
reservoirs with similar production potential as the adjacent N Pool<BR>
where 6 wells have produced 680,000 barrels oil since 1997. In overall, =
the<BR>
Sylvan Field has produced 40 million barrels of oil from the Pekisko =
formation and<BR>
50 billion cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.<BR>
<BR>
Ensign Drilling will test a total of 30 feet from several zones in =
the<BR>
Shunda formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation =
at<BR>
7,320 feet. When drilling resumes, the hole is planned to reach a total =
depth<BR>
of 7,570 feet, which may take some 10 days to then complete drilling =
and<BR>
testing.<BR>
<BR>
Each development well has probable production of 150 barrels of oil =
per<BR>
day and 750?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess =
of<BR>
1 billion cubic feet gas and 300,000 barrels of oil. There are four =
other<BR>
