<p class=3D"jiber">The English Language. Have you ever wondered why =
foreigners have trouble with the English Language?. Let's face it. =
English is a crazy language. There is no egg in the eggplant
No ham in the hamburger. And neither pine nor apple in the pineapple. =
English muffins were not invented in England. French fries were not =
invented in France. We sometimes take English for granted But if we =
examine its paradoxes we find that Quicksand takes you down slowly, =
Boxing rings are square. And a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is =
it a pig. If writers write, how come fingers don't fing. If the plural =
of tooth is teeth. Shouldn't the plural of phone booth be phone beeth, =
If the teacher taught, Why didn't the preacher praught. If a vegetarian =
eats vegetables. What the does a humanitarian eat? Why do people recite =
at a play, Yet play at a recital? Park on driveways and Drive on =
parkways. You have to marvel at the unique lunacy. Of a language where a =
house can burn up as it burns down. And in which you fill in a form by =
filling it out. And a bell is only heard once it goes! English was =
invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the =
human race (Which of course isn't a race at all) That is why when the =
stars are out they are visible, but when the lights are out they are =
invisible, and why it is that when I wind up my watch it starts, but =
when I wind up this observation, it ends.
