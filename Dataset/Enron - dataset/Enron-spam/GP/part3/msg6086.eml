Ain't no man can avoid being born average, but there ain't no man got to =
be common.Coming to Rome, much labor and little profit! The King whom =
you seek here, unless you bring Him with you will not find =
Him.<br><br>Great deeds are usually wrought at great risks.



<br><br>It is more blessed to give than to receive. [Acts =
20:35]<BR><BR>It's the economy, stupid.

<BR>Life begins on the other side of despair.<br>A lean compromise is =
better than a fat lawsuit.

<BR>Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not =
for love.<br>Playing safe is only playing.



No man is happy he is at best fortunate.


Experience tells you what to do confidence allows you to do it.



<br><br>Assassination is the extreme form of censorship.<BR><BR>Give =
every man your ear, but few thy voice. Take each man's censure, but =
reserve thy judgment. [Hamlet]<BR>Love is the true means by which the =
world is enjoyed: our love to others, and others love to us.



<BR><BR>Pity the man who has a character to support --it is worse than a =
large family -- he is silent poor indeed.

<BR>It is, after all, the responsibility of the expert to operate the =
familiar and that of the leader to transcend it.



<BR><BR>Sex alleviates tension. Love causes it.
<BR><BR>To believe in something, and not to live it, is dishonest.
