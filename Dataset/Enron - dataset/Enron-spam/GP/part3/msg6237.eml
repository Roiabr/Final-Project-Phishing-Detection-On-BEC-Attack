<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear friend,<BR>
It' s a heartfelt hope that I wrote to seek your co-operation and =
assistance in the context stated below:May I first introduce my self,My =
name is SEAN SIBANDA, the eldest son of Dr.MLULEKI SIBANDA from =
Zimbabwe. This letter might come as a surprise to you about where I got =
your contact address and how I knew you? I got your address from the =
net, and I decided to contact you for an assistant, which I do hope you =
will take this matter into consideration.<BR>
During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the =
supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned =
farms for his party members and his followers,&nbsp; he ordered all =
white farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his =
followers.<BR>
My father was one of the biggest farmers in our country and because he =
strongly opposed Mugabe's ideas,&nbsp; Mugabe's supporters invaded my =
father's farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and =
made away with a lot of items in my father's farm.<BR>
Before his death, my father had deposited with one Security Company in =
SOUTH AFRICA, the sum of US$17.5 (Seventeen Million Five Hundred =
Thousand United States Dollars). This money he planned to use in buying =
new machinery and to set up a new farm in Swaziland. After the death of =
my father,&nbsp; l decided to escape to Netherlands because of the =
continued grevious threat from Mugabe and his supporters.<BR>
As&nbsp; the senior man in the Family, l decided to contact&nbsp;&nbsp; =
you to assist me since I was able to&nbsp; moved this money out of SOUTH =
AFRICA to Holland for safe keeping although the courier comapny did not =
aware of the content of the suite case because it was convey as personal =
valuable goods.<BR>
Presently the Fund is already in Holland, while I need to seek =
political&nbsp; asylum to secure my staying here and we are not allowed =
to operate any bank account within Netherlands. In view of this plight, =
I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this =
distressed call to save me and my families from a hopeless future.<BR>
And if you agree to help, we will compensate you sincerely for your =
candid effort in this regard with 25% of the total amount of $17.5 =
Million US Dollars. In that case, when the money ($17.5 Million) is =
moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in =
your favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might =
incur and during the process of securing this fund. The remaining 65% =
will be invested meaningfully for my Families future.<BR>
All I want you to do is to help me finish this transaction and the same =
time help me to invest the money into a lucrative business in your =
country.<BR>
I look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your =
co-operation. In view of all above details, I request you to keep this =
letter and co-operation highly confidential.<BR>

transaction with absolute confidentiality. Please forward your phone/fax =
numbers and your address to my private Email address at( =
