<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>My Dear Friend ,<BR>
I am Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian Head of<BR>
state,General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while =
still<BR>
on active service for our Country.<BR>
l am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great =
assistance<BR>
to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of 24 million U.S<BR>
dollars cash which l intend to use for investment purposes outside =
Nigeria.<BR>
<BR>
This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my<BR>
husband and a Russian firm in our country\'s multi-billion dollar =
Ajaokuta<BR>
steelb plant. The Russian partners returned my husbands share being =
the<BR>
above sum after his death. Presently, the new civilian Government =
has<BR>
intensified their probe into my husbands financial resources which =
has<BR>
led to the freezing of all our accounts, local and foreign, the =
revoking<BR>
of all our business licences and the arrest of my First son.<BR>
<BR>
In view of this I acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of<BR>
our finance houses before it was closed down. I have deposited the =
money<BR>
in a security company with the help of very loyal officials of my =
late<BR>
husband. No record is known about this fund by the government =
because<BR>
there is no documentation showing that we received such funds.<BR>
Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude =
to<BR>
my&nbsp; family, I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek =
your<BR>
help in transferring this funds out of the sub-African region. Bearing =
in<BR>
mind that you may assist me, l have decided to part with &lt;20% of =
the<BR>
total sum. Your URGENT response is needed.<BR>
Please include your personal phone and fax number.<BR>
reply me with&nbsp; drmariam@e-milio.com .<BR>
Regards,<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha<BR>
