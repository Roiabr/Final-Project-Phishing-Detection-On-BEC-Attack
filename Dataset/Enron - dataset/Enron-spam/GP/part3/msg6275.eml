<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>FROM THE DESK OF:<BR>
Dr. David Dexter Odion<BR>
Guardian Express Bank Ltd.<BR>
No. 16, Stubbs Road,<BR>
Stubbs Road Branch,<BR>
Delta State,<BR>
Nigeria.<BR>
<BR>
Hello,<BR>
<BR>
I am Dr. David Dexter Odion, Bank Manager Guardian Express Bank Ltd. =
Stubbs Road Branch, Nigeria. I have an urgent and very confidential =
business proposition for you.<BR>
<BR>
A British Oil consultant and contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals =
Corporation, Mr Raymond Beck made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for =
twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve Million =
Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to =
his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a =
reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the =
Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Raymond Beck died in a plane =
crash along with his wife Mrs. Dorene Beck in an Egypt Air Flight 990, =
1999 air crash. For more information about this crash and person, you =
can check out the relative website: <A =
HREF=3D"http://www.s-t.com/daily/11-99/11-02-99/d08ho174.htm">http://www.=
s-t.com/daily/11-99/11-02-99/d08ho174.htm</A><BR>
<BR>
Since we got this information about his death and on further =
investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all =
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made =
further investigation and discovered that Mr. Raymond Beck did not =
declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, =
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of =
US$12,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being =
rolled over with the Principal sum at the end of each year. No one will =
ever come forward to claim it. According to the Laws of Nigeria, at the =
expiration of 7(seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of =
the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.<BR>
<BR>
Consequently, my proposal to you is that I will like you as a foreigner =
to stand as the next of kin to Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this =
old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. =
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names =
and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents =
and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall =
employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the =
WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of =
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A Bank Account in =
any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the =
transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money =
will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50% for =
me and 30% for you. The remaining 20% will be set aside for the entire =
expenses made in the cause of the transaction. There is no risk at all =
since the paperwork for this transaction will be done by a Legal =
Attorney of Law and my position as the Branch Manager of the issuing =
Bank guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email =
address above. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more =
details and relevant documents that will help you understand the =
transaction. Please, send me your direct telephone and fax numbers for =
easy communication.<BR>
<BR>
Please, observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this =
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall =
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.<BR>
<BR>
Awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential email address: =
