<BR>
Let's Look&nbsp; at&nbsp; The&nbsp; Company,&nbsp; Delta&nbsp; =
Mining&nbsp; and&nbsp; Exploration Corp.<BR>
OTC:DMXP&lt;p&gt;<BR>
<BR>
About The Company:&lt;p&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Delta Mining and Exploration Corp. OTC:DMXP is a mineral exploration<BR>
company&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; controls&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp; =
properties&nbsp;&nbsp; totaling&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,554&nbsp;&nbsp; acres<BR>
(approximately&nbsp; 11&nbsp; sq.&nbsp; miles)&nbsp; in Montana.&nbsp; =
The properties are all<BR>
located over&nbsp; what&nbsp; management&nbsp; considers&nbsp; to&nbsp; =
be&nbsp; some&nbsp; of the most<BR>
prospective&nbsp; diamond&nbsp; exploration&nbsp; terrain&nbsp; in&nbsp; =
the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States.<BR>
Another 10,000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties&nbsp; =
are<BR>
controlled&nbsp; in&nbsp; Bolivia,&nbsp; South&nbsp; America.&nbsp; =
Initial work has revealed<BR>
that the&nbsp; Bolivian&nbsp; properties&nbsp; display&nbsp; =
similar&nbsp; potential to those<BR>
found in North America.&lt;p&gt;<BR>
<BR>
The management team is led by Chief&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; Officer,&nbsp; =
Dr.&nbsp; Barry<BR>
Rayment,&nbsp; who&nbsp; is experienced enough to take this junior =
exploration<BR>
company&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; next&nbsp; level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; =
Rayment&nbsp; brings&nbsp; 32&nbsp; years&nbsp; of<BR>
experience in the field of&nbsp; geology,&nbsp; along with running some =
of the<BR>
most successful mining companies in the industry.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; =
Rayment&nbsp; was<BR>
the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bema&nbsp; Gold&nbsp; Corp., (AMEX: =
BGO), a company with a<BR>
market cap of close to&nbsp; a&nbsp; billion&nbsp; dollars.&nbsp; He was =
also affiliated<BR>
with Glamis Gold, Gold Fields Mining&nbsp; and&nbsp; Amselco&nbsp; =
Exploration&nbsp; (BP<BR>
Minerals),&nbsp; among&nbsp; others.&nbsp; His vast experience in the =
mining sector<BR>
along with his extensive&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; of&nbsp; public companies =
will be an<BR>
extraordinary asset to Delta and its&nbsp; shareholders&nbsp; as&nbsp; =
the&nbsp; company<BR>
moves forward.&lt;p&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Among the support team is Stephen Kay, a geologist with more than 30<BR>
years&nbsp; experience&nbsp; in&nbsp; exploration&nbsp; throughout =
Europe, South Africa,<BR>
South America and the United&nbsp; States.&nbsp; While with Gold Fields =
Mining<BR>
Corp., Stephen Kay was instrumental in the discovery and&nbsp; =
subsequent<BR>
drilling of the 3 million ounce Mesquite gold deposit in =
California.&lt;p&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Delta&nbsp; has&nbsp; experienced&nbsp; significant&nbsp; =
technical&nbsp; success&nbsp; since&nbsp; its<BR>
start-up&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; example,&nbsp; =
Delta&nbsp; has discovered the first<BR>
in-situ&nbsp; microdiamond&nbsp; ever&nbsp; found&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; =
Montana&nbsp; on&nbsp; its&nbsp; Homestead<BR>
Kimberlite, southeast of Lewistown.&nbsp; The Company also =
controls&nbsp; part<BR>
of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Three Buttes Kimberlite where initial exploration has =
shown<BR>
The&nbsp; Three&nbsp; Buttes&nbsp; Kimberlite&nbsp; to&nbsp; host&nbsp; =
typical&nbsp; diamond indicator<BR>
minerals - a major step toward&nbsp; finding&nbsp; the&nbsp; =
presence&nbsp; of&nbsp; economic<BR>
diamonds - including pyrope (garnet), chromite and =
clinoprroxene.&lt;p&gt;<BR>
<BR>
An&nbsp; aggressive&nbsp; regional&nbsp; exploration&nbsp; program&nbsp; =
has the potential to<BR>
discover&nbsp; additional&nbsp;&nbsp; kimberlite&nbsp;&nbsp; =
or&nbsp;&nbsp; lamproite&nbsp;&nbsp; pipes&nbsp; in&nbsp; this<BR>
under-explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing<BR>
kimberlites in Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada. &lt;p&gt;<BR>
<BR>
In Bolivia, Delta controls&nbsp; approximately&nbsp; two-thirds&nbsp; =
of&nbsp; a&nbsp; highly<BR>
prospective&nbsp; diamondiferous terrain referred to as the =
Independencia<BR>
group of concessions covering 7,860&nbsp; acres (12 sq miles).&nbsp; The =
other<BR>
one-third is presently being explored by De Beers.&nbsp; In&nbsp; =
addition&nbsp; to<BR>
the&nbsp; Independencia&nbsp; property&nbsp; Delta&nbsp; controls&nbsp; =
more than 2,000 acres<BR>
comprising the highly attractive&nbsp; Precambrian property that =
displays<BR>
all the&nbsp; diamond&nbsp; indicator&nbsp; minerals&nbsp; that&nbsp; =
would&nbsp; suggest&nbsp; further<BR>
exploration is justified.&lt;p&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing<BR>
its&nbsp; extensive&nbsp; portfolio of diamond exploration properties =
but also<BR>
by acquiring additional&nbsp; diamond&nbsp; properties.&nbsp;&nbsp; =
Delta&nbsp; will focus on<BR>
identifying and developing strategic&nbsp; alliances&nbsp; with&nbsp; =
major&nbsp; mining<BR>
companies&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as joint ventures to develop the =
properties and<BR>
finance additional exploration.&lt;p&gt;<BR>
<BR>
In addition&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; highly&nbsp; prospective&nbsp; =
diamond&nbsp; properties Delta<BR>
controls, they also control a gold property&nbsp; with&nbsp; great&nbsp; =
potential.<BR>
The&nbsp; property&nbsp; is&nbsp; near&nbsp; La&nbsp; Paz&nbsp; in =
Bolivia, where initial analysis<BR>
revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an<BR>
extensive exploration program.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<BR>
