ATTN:M.D/CEO<BR>
Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to<BR>
you. I believe you are a highly respected personality,<BR>
considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a<BR>
human resource profile database on your country. Though, I<BR>
do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and<BR>
fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed<BR>
consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins.<BR>
<BR>
My name is MRS. RITA NUHAN VAYE from Liberia, a Country in<BR>
West Africa. My Husband is Isaac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy<BR>
Minister of Public Works, Liberia. My Husband was falsely<BR>
accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA<BR>
(CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor<BR>
killed him. You can verify this from your country. You can<BR>
also check in some of the international newspapers posted<BR>
in the web sites below:<BR>

<BR>
Before my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5<BR>
million through a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a<BR>
Security Company Abroad. All that is needed is for my<BR>
lawyer to instruct the company to transfer the funds to<BR>
your account, I will remunerate you with 20% at the end of<BR>
the transaction, but most of all is that I solicit your<BR>
trust in this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
I have been confined only to our country home and all my<BR>
calls are monitored, So I will advise you contact my<BR>
private Attorney on his contact stated above for onward<BR>
proceedings.<BR>
<BR>
kindly include your private telephone and fax numbers where<BR>
you can always be reached, your residential or company<BR>
address to enable him send detail information/documents to<BR>
you.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks and God bless you and your Family.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
MRS. RITA NUHAN VAYE<BR>
