Breaking News!!<BR>
<BR>
April 29,- Montana Oil and Gas reports the following update on its<BR>
Sylvan Lake project. After several delays due to unseasonable weather =
and<BR>
road closures in the province of Alberta, the contracted drilling =
rig<BR>
was moved onto location and Ensign Drilling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 =
W5M<BR>
well. The company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in<BR>
compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the =
well<BR>
immediately there after.<BR>
<BR>
The company's West Lock project is also scheduled to resume =
completion<BR>
of tie in upon lifting of the road ban.<BR>
<BR>
With the continued interest in our Sylvan Lake project Montana Oil =
and<BR>
Gas has prepared a detailed project description.<BR>
<BR>
Project History<BR>
<BR>
The Sylvan Lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950's =
and<BR>
has produced over 40 million barrels (mbbls) of high quality crude =
oil<BR>
and 50 billion cubic feet (bcf) of associated natural gas,<BR>
predominantly from the Mississippian Pekisko and Shunda formations. The =
field<BR>
remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled =
and<BR>
expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics.<BR>
<BR>
The original freehold lease on section 3-38-3W5M was leased to a =
major<BR>
oil company, as was most of the Sylvan Lake field itself. An<BR>
exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7-3-38-3W5M in =
1958 and was<BR>
abandoned after finding the Shunda and Pekisko formations completely<BR>
eroded by post depositional cutting. As a consequence, the major =
company<BR>
did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to =
the<BR>
complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the<BR>
deeper mineral rights (below the base of the Jurassic formations) on =
the<BR>
west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner =
in<BR>
the early 1960's. This relinquishment was extraordinary at the time =
as<BR>
mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more<BR>
specifically, not often by the major companies. Accordingly, these =
mineral<BR>
rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000's as almost all =
oil<BR>
and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee.<BR>
Through diligent land work (including field visits) our partners =
discovered<BR>
this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3. =
Since<BR>
that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres<BR>
(one quarter section) of section 3. Energy 51 has the right to earn =
50%<BR>
of this prospect (possibly 75%) with the drilling of a test well in<BR>
5-3-38-3W5M.<BR>
<BR>
Land Discussion<BR>
<BR>
Our partners have secured a 100% working interest in the west half =
and<BR>
northeast quarter of section 3-38-3W5M. The land comprises some 480<BR>
acres (one section or one square mile equals 640 acres). Primary =
drilling<BR>
spacing in Alberta is as follows; one quarter section spacing (160<BR>
acres) for oil and one section spacing (640 acres) for natural gas. =
The<BR>
Province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units<BR>
(called &quot;Holdings&quot;) should you be able to prove to the =
Province's<BR>
satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from =
increased<BR>
well density. Almost the entire Sylvan Lake field, Pekisko pool, has<BR>
been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in =
discovering<BR>
Pekisko oil we will down space as well.<BR>
<BR>
Geological Discussion<BR>
<BR>
Pekisko Formation -- The principle target of this prospect is oil =
and<BR>
associated gas production from the deeper (older) Pekisko formation. =
The<BR>
Sylvan Lake Pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of =
the<BR>
Pekisko formation. This edge is extremely rugged as its shape was<BR>
influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions. =
Overlying<BR>
this ancient shoreline are cap rocks (impermeable layers) of the<BR>
Mississippian Lower Shunda formation and Cretaceous/Jurassic =
impermeable<BR>
shales. These erosional edge trap features are common throughout Alberta =
and<BR>
account for billions of barrels of reserves.<BR>
<BR>
Production Facilities Discussion<BR>
<BR>
This immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas<BR>
over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a multitude of gas =
gathering<BR>
and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have =
been<BR>
constructed.<BR>
<BR>
A major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our<BR>
project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our =
proposed<BR>
drilling location. The capacity of the processing facility is<BR>
approximately 70 mmcf/d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf/d. =
Accordingly,<BR>
excess capacity of 24 mmcf/d exists in the facility which would be =
in<BR>
the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible.<BR>
<BR>
This gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the<BR>
transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north =
of<BR>
Red Deer, Alberta. Accordingly, trucking costs would be minimal to =
get<BR>
oil product to the transportation system.<BR>
