MARIETTA, GA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jul 9, 2004 -- JAVA GROUP INC. (Other =
OTC:JVGI.PK - News) announces company's go forward initiatives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The company will commence its focus on four key areas: venue =
acquisition, minor league team acquisition, sports management and league =
ownership.<BR>
<BR>
The Company is actively seeking potential acquisition and partnership =
targets in the sports facility and venue sectors. The Company has =
initially targeted two facilities in North America. An ideal candidate =
will be a multi use venue with seating capacity of 8000 - 10000 people, =
ample parking and concessions.<BR>
<BR>
The Company is also soliciting Professional Minor Division I, II and III =
league sports teams in the ice hockey, baseball, soccer, football, and =
basketball and lacrosse sectors. The Company finds that the potential =
for growth in these markets is ample enough to grow this division of the =
company into a major ownership player in the professional &quot;Minor =
Sports Vertical.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A natural vertical for the Company to participate in is the Sports =
Management area. The Company shall focus on specific up and coming =
athletes on a broad sports spectrum and represent them in the capacity =
of agent and/or branding areas of their careers.<BR>
<BR>
The Company continues to seek ownership positions in single entity and =
passive single entity leagues in all sports. The company feels a strong =
foothold in these areas will allow the Company to bolster and feed the =
companies other divisions.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate formulation of these four areas will allow the Company to =
cluster multiple teams in a single venue in cities through out North =
America. This clustering strategy will allow the Company to use one =
common &quot;Corporate Management Team&quot; in each city to oversee and =
operate multiple concepts. This leads to cost effectiveness, focused =
management, maximum utilization of management at all levels from tickets =
sales to game day operations and this strategy shall also ensure that =
the Company risk on a per market basis is diversified.<BR>
