The quality of included studies was poor overall  We did not detect bias
induced by any of the measures assessed  We could not obtain data on all
cause fatality for 33% of studies  It is unlikely that missing results =
would
shift the results for studies comparing the same  lactam relative risk 1 =
02
0 76 to 1 38 but it is of concern that studies comparing different  =
lactams
0 85 0 69 to 1 05 may not detect important harm to patients  <BR>
Our assessment of treatment effects for patients with P aeruginosa Gram
negative and blood infections relies on subgroup analysis  We did not =
detect
an advantage for combination therapy among these patients  Only few =
patients
with documented P aeruginosa infections could be evaluated  <BR>
