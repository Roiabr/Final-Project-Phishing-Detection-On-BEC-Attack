<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oil and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,<BR>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US &quot;Oi| =
Be|t&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potential of Mi||ions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
<BR>
VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision =
to<BR>
exp|ore the development of dril|ing programs in Wyoming (USA), as =
we||<BR>
as Alberta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, =
that<BR>
inc|ude existing production, are developing rapid|y. Emerson wi|l<BR>
announce further detai|s as lease opportunities and contract =
negotiations<BR>
come to fruition.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri||ing<BR>
programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, =
as<BR>
we|l as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very<BR>
optimistic that with its current dea| f|ow it wil| be ab|e to bui|d a =
so|id<BR>
foundation to grow.<BR>
<BR>
David Harker, Emerson President stated, &quot;We at Emerson are =
aggressive|y<BR>
pursuing a|| possible<BR>
Opp0rtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many<BR>
situations we wil| have the<BR>
0pp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dri||ing program, =
which<BR>
will a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbol - EOGI<BR>
Price - .09<BR>
<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu|l<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and<BR>
even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to =
underva|ued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| =
company<BR>
with a comparab|y small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But a|l that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive<BR>
effect on the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or<BR>
dec|ine<BR>
slight|y, you wil| sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings<BR>
wil|<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
rea|ized,<BR>
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and<BR>
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive<BR>
production.<BR>
Early investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news =
in<BR>
this<BR>
area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bul|etin.<BR>
