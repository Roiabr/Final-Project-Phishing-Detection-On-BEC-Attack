style=3D&quot;font-face:arial&quot;&gt;Hello Friend,<BR>
<BR>
Hope you are doing great and sound? I am Dr. Ronald<BR>
Matheson Barrister at law and attorney to late Sir Mark<BR>
Stephanopoulos, a Greek Merchant otherwise known as my<BR>
client who was based in the United Kingdom and died of<BR>
complications from injuries sustained after a ghastly<BR>
motor accident.<BR>
<BR>
As the attorney to Sir Mark Stephanopoulos I was his<BR>
confidant as he shared with me virtually everything<BR>
about himself, his business and family. I was his<BR>
attorney for 15years and during that period I wrote<BR>
his WILL and was also named as the executor, which has<BR>
since been fulfilled. I am also aware due to my<BR>
closeness to him that the amount Ten Million Pounds he<BR>
deposited with a bank in Europe was not willed out. He<BR>
told me about this on his sick bed and even instructed<BR>
that I should prepare a codicil to that effect,<BR>
however before I could finish my work he had died.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
After his death, funeral and subsequent execution of<BR>
his will I went into action to ascertain the<BR>
information passed unto me by my client. My<BR>
investigation conformed to the information; at that<BR>
point I knew I had to do something to move the funds<BR>
out of the bank and knowing that I cannot do this<BR>
alone I have decided to contact you and seek your<BR>
assistance and acceptance to be the next of kin to the<BR>
estate.<BR>
<BR>
Aside my humble self and you, the relationship manager<BR>
(account officer) of my client knows about this, for<BR>
he was very helpful during my discreet investigation,<BR>
through him I was able to see the deposit paper work<BR>
of the money which confirmed that there is no next of<BR>
kin to the funds. It is necessary for us to move the<BR>
money out of the bank on time because if we do not do<BR>
this within the next two years the bank would regard<BR>
the money as sundry funds, which would give them the<BR>
right to claim the money.<BR>
<BR>
I cannot move the money in my name because he is my<BR>
client, for it could arose suspicion, his account<BR>
officer cannot do the same, hence the importance of<BR>
your assistance. Have my assurance that there is<BR>
nothing to fear about, as we also need your assurance<BR>
that you would work with me without fear or favour to<BR>
achieve our desired objective. The legal back up is no<BR>
problem for I would be responsible. Since the codicil<BR>
was not ready before his death, letter of<BR>
administration without Will would be secured from the<BR>
probate office, with this letter I would personally<BR>
apply on your behalf to the bank for the release of<BR>
the funds to you.<BR>
<BR>
What I require from you to enable us achieve the above<BR>
are your;<BR>
&nbsp;Names<BR>
Address<BR>
&nbsp;Date of Birth<BR>
&nbsp;Telephone and Fax numbers<BR>
<BR>
Upon receipt of a confirmation of acceptance from you<BR>
a sharing ratio would be worked out between the three<BR>
of us and communicated to you along with my telephone<BR>
number.in the light of above, your positive responses<BR>
would be appreciated through my email<BR>
(matheson044@netscape.com)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Take care and have a nice day.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>
Ronald&nbsp; Matheson<BR>
Mathwood Associates.&lt;/pre&gt;<BR>
