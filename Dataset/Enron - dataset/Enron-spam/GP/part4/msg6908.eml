Super-Hot Mining Play<br>
Mining Companies Scoring With Record Earnings<br>
And Industry-Wide Merger-Mania Positions<br>
UDVE with Huge Reserves to Jump 500% !<br>
Analysts confirm mining boom on record bottom line <br>
net-earnings!
<p>United Development International (UDVE) controls one <br>
  of the largest gold mining properties in Guyana <br>
  (South America). Recent geological data has confirmed <br>
  PROVEN RESERVES of over 400,000 ounces of gold with a <br>
  value of over $100 MILLION.<br>
  <br>
  PriceWaterhouseCoopers head analyst for mining, Paul <br>
  Murphy, stated just last month, &quot;We seem to be at the <br>
  start of the first mining boom of the 21st century.</p>
<p>&quot; This statement accompanied the PriceWaterhouse report <br>
  detailing the record doubling of net-profits for mining <br>
  companies in 2003 with an even brighter outlook for 2004.<br>
  Hot gold plays are no longer taking a back seat, and UDVE <br>
  is a prime example of a winner about to explode trading <br>
  at .07 that should be trading at .50! UDVE is currently <br>
  in production of high-grade gold ore while generating <br>
  revenues and positive cash flow.<br>
  <br>
  Major Headlines and Highlights- July 29, 2004: UDVE Completes <br>
  Bulk Sampling Producing a Total of 1,311 Ounces of Gold. <br>
  This initial sampling validates recent estimates of $140 <br>
  MILLION Revenue Forecast from UDVE operating properties!<br>
  Merger Activity is heightened with the rise of gold mining <br>
  company gains!</p>
<p>Gold prices that huddled near $250 in '99 are now showing <br>
  strength again near $400 after reaching $430. <br>
  UDVE has begun to heat up by jumping from .04 to .08 on <br>
  large block accumulation.</p>
<p>REUTERS Newswire reported last quarter that mergers and <br>
  acquisitions are becoming more frequent in gold mining <br>
  companies with the expectation of that trend increasing. <br>
  Large-cap fund managers and securities analysts agree that <br>
  the junior mining group is especially more vulnerable to a <br>
  buy-out or takeover scenario in today's healthy mining <br>
  environment.</p>
<p>We believe that UDVE is a serious takeover target as the <br>
  price for this undervalued asset play has not even come <br>
  close to reaching its true potential. Based on the value <br>
  of their proven reserves, we should see .25 right away <br>
  with even greater significant upside to match the fast-paced <br>
  growth of the Company.</p>
