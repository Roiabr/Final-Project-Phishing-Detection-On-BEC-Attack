<BR>sorry not for me and the address is above<BR>
Antibiotic treatment is nearly always instituted empirically and is =
often continued with no isolate to direct specific treatment  Most =
trials assessed this scenario and do not support a benefit for =
combination therapy  Clinicians may still opt for combination empirical =
treatment to increase the probability of appropriate empirical treatment =
which has indeed been shown to improve survival 90 91 Current evidence =
suggests that aminoglycoside monotherapy may be inadequate for =
infections outside the urinary tract 10 92 93 <BR>
Thus for the purpose of enhancing antimicrobial spectrum aminoglycosides =
may constitute a poor choice  Combination treatment is considered for =
patients with severe infections  However these are the patients most =
prone to harm by the addition of an aminoglycoside  <BR>
<BR>
These were now brilliantly lighted, and crowds of pleasure seekers =
thronged them everywhere
