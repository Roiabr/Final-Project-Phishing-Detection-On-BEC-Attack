Now that I have had both services, and having noticed that a google =
search
yields no definitive answers for people, I wanted to post my personal =
review
of the two systems.

I have an Alpine CDA-7878 and an Alpine XM unit and a Panasonic Sirius =
unit,
both with Terk antennas.  The Alpine unit was connected to the head unit =
via
an AiNet cable and the Sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary RCA
adapter available from Alpine (KCA-121B).  I had XM since it debuted and
Sirius for a few months in the Pacific Northwest.

The bottom line, for those needing a quick answer, is Sirius is superior =
in
sound quality, features(free streaming from their website!), and channel
quality(better music, no commercials, better talk). XM has a few more
channels that make very little difference to the end result (read on).

After careful review of both systems, Sirius came out the winnner, as I =
have
said.  The channels are laid out well, lack commercials, sound great, =
and
are streamed on the internet.  The only disadvantage of Sirius was its
oft-sited lack of Nascar, which they seem to be trying to remedy.  Also, =
XM
has an extra comedy channel (it's boring, and features older, censored
comedy), and a few more "experimental" music channels which most will =
find
totally useless.  Surfing XM for music is often like surfing the regular
(terrestrial) radio in a large city-you get nothing but frustration.  =
It's
no wonder XM doesn't stream live on the net so that you can try before =
you
buy.  Also, XM's channel layout was unfriendly, in my opinion.

The greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two, however, =
are
the staggeringly stupid and annoying XM commercials.  Not necessarily =
the
corporate commercials that come from outside companies (which are =
annoying
in an expected way), but the ridiculous and loud in-house XM stuff that
makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you've had it =
up
loud-especially with the windows open (yes, they are that embarrassing).
This, and the better performance of Sirius, was the deciding factor in =
my
cancelling XM.

XM, however, holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent
music and a fair selection of Talk.  If not for Sirius, I would have =
kept
XM, I think; probably because it IS nice to listen to the same station =
no
matter where you go.  Yet, as is the way of competition, Sirius has =
offered
everything good that XM does and DONE IT RIGHT.  Sirius outshines in the
talk category, with a variety of Right and Left-wing shows, all of the
useful talk channels XM has, and NPR, PRI, and a well laid-out channel =
plan.

XM does a bit better in the design of their customer care website.  =
Sirius
also has a customer care website, but it is not as robust (less detail).
However, XM doesn't have streaming audio on its website-apparently we =
all
have to pay XM $6.99 extra in additon to buying another $200 receiver =
for
the house.  In addition to the crappy commercials, this is probably =
where
the corporate influence of XM being part-owned by ClearChannel and GM =
shows.
