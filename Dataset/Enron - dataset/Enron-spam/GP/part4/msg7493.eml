<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>HANG SENG BANK LTD.<BR>
CHANG HUI, BRANCH,<BR>
CENTRAL HONG KONG,<BR>
HONK KONG.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr Cheung Pui director of =
operations Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an obscured business suggestion =
for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who =
was with the Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed =
deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of twenty four millions =
five hundred thousand United State Dollars in my branch. Upon maturity =
several notices was sent to him, even during the war earlier this year. =
Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response =
came from him. We later found out that the<BR>
Major and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that =
hit their home. After further investigations it was also discovered that =
Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers =
including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me =
the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his =
deposit in my bank.As you can see, twenty four million five hundred =
thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will =
ever come forward to claim it.<BR>
What bothers me most is that according to the by-laws of my country at =
the expiration of 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the =
Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.<BR>
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a =
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem so that you =
will be able to receive his funds.<BR>
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:<BR>
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we =
will come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare =
the necessary<BR>
&nbsp; document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi =
Basem, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide =
me with your full name and address so that the attorney can commence his =
job, after you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also =
file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary documentation =
for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by =
you.<BR>
There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt =
a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary =
documents. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters =
concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred, we shall =
share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses =
incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested =
please send me your private phone and fax<BR>
numbers for easy communication and finally after that I shall provide =
you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this =
letter will be appreciated. Please do copy your response to =
chuengpi@walla.com where I have email alert on my cell phone.<BR>
<BR>
Kind Regards<BR>
<BR>
Mr.Cheung. P.<BR>
