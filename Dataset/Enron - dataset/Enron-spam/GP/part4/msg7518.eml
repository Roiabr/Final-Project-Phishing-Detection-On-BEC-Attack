DEAR ,<BR>
<BR>
This letter was borne out of my sincere desire to establish a<BR>
business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through =
the<BR>
international trade and commerce (ITCC).<BR>
<BR>
My name is Ibram Kamara the son of late Chief Abraham P.Kamara (the =
former<BR>
<BR>
deputy minister of finance under the ousted civilian government) who =

<BR>
killed and mutilated by the military junta led by major, Paul Koroma =
after<BR>
<BR>
overthrowing the elected government of president Tejan. Through, I do =

<BR>
Sadly, my mother died of cancer 2 months ago and was buried here in =
South<BR>
<BR>

europe<BR>
<BR>
the deposit that worth US$25,000,000 ( Twenty five million U.S =

this<BR>
was the money paid to his corporation by it's overseas customers in =
the<BR>
