<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Friend,<BR>
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I<BR>
believe everyone will die someday. My name is JONATHAN CARU from =
NORWAY<BR>
I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .<BR>
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have<BR>
only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I =
have<BR>
not<BR>
particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for<BR>
anyone(not even myself)but my business.<BR>
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to<BR>
people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I<BR>
cared<BR>
for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to =
life<BR>
than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I =
believe<BR>
when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live =
my<BR>
life a different way from how I have lived it.<BR>
<BR>
Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my =
property<BR>
and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a =
few<BR>
close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, =
I<BR>
have decided to give also to charity organizations, tsunami victims, =
and<BR>
&nbsp;orphanage homes,<BR>
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, =
I<BR>
&nbsp;have distributed<BR>
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and =
Malaysia.<BR>
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this =
myself<BR>
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my =
accounts<BR>
and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization =
in<BR>
Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to =
themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended<BR>
with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one =
knows<BR>
of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars $18,000.000<BR>
that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you =
to<BR>
help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity =
organizations.<BR>
<BR>
I have set aside 20% for you and some expences that may incure =
during<BR>
the proccess of these transaction.<BR>
God be with you.<BR>
<BR>
Jonathan Caru<BR>
