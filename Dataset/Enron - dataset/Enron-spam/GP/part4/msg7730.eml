Digital Color Print, Inc. (&quot;DCPI&quot;), through it's wholly owned =
subsidiary Logical=20
Imaging Solutions (&quot;LIS&quot;), is in the business of supplying =
high-speed digital=20
printing systems and supplies to the commercial printing industry. The =
printing=20
systems are unique in technical concept and application. The systems are =
totally=20
digital, designed to mount on existing offset web presses and =
significantly=20
improve the functionality of the press, not as a replacement - but as an =

enhancement. The printing process is called Electron Beam Imaging =
(&quot;EBI&quot;), and=20
is significantly faster the convention laser printing - the only =

competing technology.<br>
<br>
Printing is America's third largest manufacturing industry; employing =
more than=20
1.2 million people in almost 46,000 establishments. The printing =
industry,=20
during 2002, produced over $165 billion of printed products and =

NYSE-listed Dover=20
Corporation, the largest manufacturer of offset web presses, estimates =

there are more than 35,000 presses installed in the U.S., with a press =
costing=20
from $150,000 to several million and using as much as $10,000 of =
consumable=20
products per month.<br>
<br>
Offset presses print all types of documents; forms, labels, tickets, =
tags,=20
advertisements and direct mail pieces, at production rates of 500=20
pages-per-minute (&quot;ppm&quot;) to thousands of ppm. However, the =
printed materials=20
produced are each identical, as each image printed is the =
&quot;offset&quot; inked image=20
derived from the printing plates that are mounted on the offset press. =
The great=20
limitations of the offset process are that each image (page) remains =
identical=20
unless the printing plates are changed. Also the inking of the plates =
requires=20
the laborious tasks of mixing the inks for each plate, inking the plates =
and=20
then cleaning the press for the next job. If the print job requires =
variable=20
information, such as; name, address, bar codes, dates, prices, this must =
be=20
added in a distinctly separate print operation. Typically this task is =

and in line with the offset presses traditional production of a colorful =

product. As a simple example: In the production of an event ticket such =
as a &quot;Superbowl&quot;=20
ticket, all fixed or non-variable information, such as the =
&quot;colorful=20
photo-quality&quot; front cover and the stadium rules and disclaimers on =
the reverse=20

information on each ticket. A second printing process is then required =
to add=20

numbers,=20
price and date of the event. This function can be accomplished, in line, =
by an=20
LIS provided system.<br>
<br>
LIS printing systems are entirely digital and are dry &quot;Toner&quot; =
based, which=20
precludes the laborious press set-up and clean-up tasks, ink mixing and =
storage=20
and the production of printing plates. The pressman simply runs the =
paper=20
directly through LIS's printer and it becomes an integral part of the =
press and=20
the starting and stopping of the press and the placement of the digital =
object=20
