<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>ATTN;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Sir/Madam.<BR>
<BR>
I Am Mr.Michael fisher, in charge of bills and foreign exchange =
remittance Department of Barclay's Bank.<BR>
<BR>
I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to =
carry out this business opportunity in my department. We discovered an =
unclaimed sum of =A324.5Million (Twenty-four million five hundred =
thousand British Pounds Sterling) in an account belonging to one of our =
customer, who died in a Car crash with the entire family in year =
2001.<BR>
Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next =
of kin to come over and claim his money. Unfortunately,neither the =
family nor the relation has appeared to claim this money. We cannot =
release this money unless somebody applies as the next of kin or =
relation to the deceased.<BR>
<BR>
Our banking guidelines indicated that if such money remained unclaimed =
for a period of four (4) years, it would be transferred into Barclay's =
Bank Treasury as unclaimed fund. Another officer and I in the department =
now decided to transfer this money into your account as the next of kin =
or relation of the deceased for easy collection since nobody is coming =
for it and we don't want this money to go back into the bank treasury as =
the unclaimed debt. In fact it is my friend that advised me to urgently =
arrange to transfer out this money through another foreign beneficiary =
outside the country.<BR>
<BR>
We have decided to give you 20% of the total sum. So please, as a matter =
of urgency send to me your telephone and fax numbers for effective =
communication. I will do my best to see that we conclude this =
transaction successfully on time.<BR>
Please if you are interested send me an immediate mail so that I can =
explain the details to you, so you could understand everything about =
this business Waiting for your urgent response.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you.<BR>
