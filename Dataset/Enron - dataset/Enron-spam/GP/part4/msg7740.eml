On a special Teachers Day, a kindergarten teacher was receiving gifts =
from<BR>
her pupils. The florist's son handed her a gift. She shook it, held =
it<BR>
overhead, and said, &quot;I bet I know what it is----some flowers.&quot; =
&quot;That's<BR>
right&quot; the boy said, &quot;but how did you know?&quot; &quot;Oh, =
just a wild guess,&quot; she<BR>
said. The next pupil was the candy store owner's daughter. The teacher =
held<BR>
her gift overhead, shook it, and said, &quot;I bet I can guess what it =
is----a<BR>
box of candy.&quot; &quot;That's right, but how did you know? &quot; =
asked the girl. &quot;Oh,<BR>
just a wild guess,&quot; said the teacher. The next gift was from the =
son of the<BR>
liquor store owner. The teacher held it overhead, but it was leaking. =
She<BR>
touched a drop of the leakage with her finger and touched it to her =
tongue.<BR>
&quot;Is it wine?&quot; she asked. &quot;No&quot; the boy replied. The =
teacher repeated the<BR>
process, touching another drop of the leakage to her tongue. &quot;Is =
it<BR>
champagne?&quot; she asked. &quot;No&quot; the boy replied. The teacher =
then said, &quot;I give<BR>
up, what is it?&quot; The boy replied, &quot;A puppy!&quot;<BR>
A young man was walking through a super market to pick up a few things =
when<BR>
he noticed an old lady following him. !0Pardon me,&quot; she said. =
&quot;I'm sorry if<BR>
my staring at you has made you feel uncomfortable. It's just that you =
look<BR>
just like my son, who died recently.!1 I!/m very sorry,&quot; replied =
the young<BR>
man, &quot;is there anything I can do for you?!1 Yes,&quot; she said, =
&quot;as I'm leaving,<BR>
would you say!/ Goodbye, mother?' It would make me feel so much =
better.!1<BR>
Sure,&quot; answered the young man. As the old woman was leaving, he =
called<BR>
out,!1 Goodbye, Mother!&quot;&nbsp; Then, as he stepped up to the =
checkout counter, he<BR>
saw that his total was $127.00. &quot;How can that be?&quot; he =
asked.&nbsp; &quot;I only<BR>
purchased a few things!!1 The clerk replied, &quot;Your mother said =
you'd pay for<BR>
her.&quot;<BR>
