A notoriously absent-minded professor was one day observed walking =
along<BR>
the street with one foot continually in the gutter, the other on the<BR>
pavement.A pupil meeting him said:&quot;Good evening, professor. How =
are<BR>
you?&quot;&quot;Well,&quot; answered the professor, &quot;I thought I =
was all right when I left<BR>
home, but now I don't know what's the matter with me. I've been limping =
for<BR>
the last half-hour.&quot;<BR>
Three tourists climbed up the tower with London's Big Ben and decided =
to<BR>
throw their watches off the top, run down the stairs and try to catch =
them<BR>
before they hit the ground. The first tourist threw his watch but heard =
it<BR>
crash before the had taken three steps. the second threw his watch and =
made<BR>
only tow steps before hearing his watch shatter . The third tourist =
threw<BR>
his watch off the tower, went down the stairs, bought a snack at a shop =
up<BR>
the street and walked slowly back to Big Ben in time to catch the =
watch.&quot;<BR>
How did you do that?&quot; asked one of his friends. &quot; My watch is =
30 minutes<BR>
slow.&quot; he explained.<BR>
