where they chopped me into tiny pieces.<br> <br>Then he threw me into a =
stack of old newspapers, where I sat for a month. I felt sorry for the =
newspaper on the bottom of the stack. The big sister and her book. For =
once in a long time, I was happy. Suddenly I felt strange =
and...different. Finally, I was taken back to that horrible place all =
the other newspapers and I were made into new paper. </font></p>
