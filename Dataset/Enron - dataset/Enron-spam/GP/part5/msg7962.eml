Sergio Hoffmann, 25 y.o. psychotherapist, Germany:
I think i'm younkger than main target group of Cialdis consumers, but i
have a very hard work, i always had to listen about people's failures, =
about bad life et cetera.
All that problems affected my selxual activity, my wife was not as happy =
as before with me.
I tried Viagras - both genedric and Pfdizer's, but they does not act as =
good and as long as i want it to be.
Finally, my colleague told me about Cialdis and i ordered it. The =
results were really better, trust a doctor.
I'd recommend it to anybody with erectlion troubles.
P.S.: By the way, you can mix Cialis with alcohol without any harm!
