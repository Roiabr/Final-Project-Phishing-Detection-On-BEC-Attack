DEAREST ONE MY FAMILY NEED YOU.SAFE OUR LIFE PLS,<BR>
<BR>
Dearest one,<BR>
<BR>
I greet you in the name of our lord Jesus Christ. My<BR>
name is MRS. MARY NWAOKOLO I am a widow and a mother<BR>
of two (2) all girls. I know you will see my letter to<BR>
you as an embarrassment considering the fact that we do<BR>
not know ourselves.<BR>
<BR>
I plead with you to be patient with me I feel very<BR>
pleased to contact you for some assistance and<BR>
business relationship.<BR>
<BR>
I live in Nigeria with my children. My late husband<BR>
was a loving, caring and hardworking businessman who<BR>
died unfortunately In a ghastly auto crash.<BR>
<BR>
Before the sudden death of my beloved husband, and<BR>
father of my daughters,my late husband intended to<BR>
establish a business in the united states of America<BR>
with the sum of$30 million united states dollars, but<BR>
unfortunately he died before this proposed venture.<BR>
Following his death, his family members insisted that<BR>
I am not entitled to his property (Assets and money)<BR>
since I am a woman and my offspring's all girls as I<BR>
do not have a male child for my husband.<BR>
<BR>
Well, according to some barbaric traditional laws here<BR>
in Nigeria (Africa)which doesn't permit a woman to<BR>
inherit a man's property, as they are expected by<BR>
tradition to take over the management of his business<BR>
and other properties including myself who<BR>
automatically becomes a wife to one of his immediate<BR>
brothers.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately to this wicked family members, the $30<BR>
million united states dollars which my late husband<BR>
intended to use in establishing a business in the<BR>
United States was deposited in a bank account unknown<BR>
to his family.<BR>
<BR>
I and the lawyer is the only one aware of this money,<BR>
so I have discussed this matter with a staff of the<BR>
bank that i want this money personally so that I will<BR>
be able to take care of my children's educational<BR>
needs since my husband's family members vehemently opposed<BR>
the furtherance of their education. According to the<BR>
staff of the bank, the best way to secure this money<BR>
is to transfer this money to a bank account outside<BR>
Nigeria For safe-keeping,later it will b e used for<BR>
business establishment subject to the Advise of<BR>
whosoever finally assists us.<BR>
<BR>
At this juncture, I therefore ask for your sincere<BR>
assistance in providing us with your contact information and bank =
details inorder to facilitate the remittance of this<BR>
fund into your nominated account.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as I get your positive response, I shall<BR>
provide you with all the necessary detail for this<BR>
transfer. However, I have decided to to give you<BR>
25% of the total money as a reward for your sincere<BR>
assistance and the 65% of the money will be for my<BR>
investment while 5% of the money will be mapped<BR>
aside for local and international expenses as I will<BR>
want to keep aglow my late husbands dream of investing<BR>
in real estate or any lucrative business that you may<BR>
want us to invest the money into in your country.<BR>
<BR>
To be able to help me, kindly send through my email,<BR>
your personal details including your contact<BR>
information for easy communication.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks you for your anticipated response.<BR>
