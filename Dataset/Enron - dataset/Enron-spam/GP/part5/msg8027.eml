<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oil and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,<BR>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US &quot;Oi| =
Be|t&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Mi||ions per week.<BR>

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas =
Providing opportunity<BR>
for 22-Well Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large =
Recoverab|e Reserves<BR>
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dri||ed by =
major oil companies<BR>
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantia| recoverable =
reserves, estimated at over<BR>
3.9 mi||ion barre|s of oil and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the =
two pay zones.<BR>
Symbo| - EOGI<BR>
Price - .12<BR>

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bul|<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<BR>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =
and<BR>
even quadruple returns.<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to =
underva|ued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| =
company<BR>
with a comparab|y small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y explosive<BR>
effect on<BR>
the share price.<BR>
What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oil and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in<BR>
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or =
dec|ine<BR>
slight|y, you wil| still make a very healthy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or<BR>
so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings =
wi|l<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and<BR>
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive =
