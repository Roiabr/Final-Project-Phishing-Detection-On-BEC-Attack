opportunities in<BR>
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y =
coveted<BR>

<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|| awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.<BR>

<BR>
Symbol - MOGI<BR>
Price - .455<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bul|<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potentially worth multi-mi|lions, MOGI is se|ling for less<BR>
than 1/4 the value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. =
A|ready<BR>
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overall<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made =
triple<BR>
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
