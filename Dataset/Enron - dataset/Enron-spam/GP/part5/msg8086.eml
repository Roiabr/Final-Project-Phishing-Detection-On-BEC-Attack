Many years ago, on my way from Hong Kong to New York, I passed a<br>=20
week in San Francisco. A long time had gone by since I had been in<br>
that city, during which my ventures in the Orient had prospered <br>
beyond my hope; I was rich and could afford to revisit my own <br>
country to renew my friendship with such of the companions of<br>
my youth as still lived and remembered me with the old <br>
affection. Chief of these, I hoped, was Mohun Dampier,<br>
an old schoolmate with whom I had held a desultory <br>
correspondence which had long ceased, as is the way<br>
of correspondence between men. You may have observed <br>
that the indisposition to write a merely social letter<br>
is in the ratio of the square of the distance between<br>
you and your correspondent. It is a law. I remembered <br>
Dampier as a handsome, strong young fellow of scholarly<br>
tastes, with an aversion to work and a marked <br>
indifference to many of the things that the world<br>
cares for, including wealth, of which, however,<br>
he had inherited enough to put him beyond the reach<br>
of want. In his family, one of the oldest and most <br>
aristocratic in the country, it was, I think, a matter <br>
of pride that no member of it had ever been in trade nor <br>
politics, nor suffered any kind of distinction. Mohan was <br>
a trifle sentimental, and had in him a singular<br>
element of superstition, which led him to the study<br>
of all manner of occult subjects, although his sane <br>
mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and <br>
perilous faiths. He made daring incursions into the realm<br>
of the unreal without renouncing his residence in<br>
the partly surveyed and charted region of what <br>
we are pleased to call certitude. The night of <br>
my visit to him was stormy. The Californian winter<br>
was on, and the incessant rain splashed in the <br>
deserted streets, or, lifted by irregular gusts<br>
of wind, was hurled against the houses with incredible<br>
fury. With no small difficulty my cabman found the <br>
right place, away out toward the ocean beach,<br>
in a sparsely populated suburb. The dwelling,<br>
a rather ugly one, apparently, stood in the<br>=20
centre of its grounds, which as nearly as I could<br>
make out in the gloom were destitute of either<br>
flowers or grass. Three or four trees, writhing<br>
and moaning in the torment of the tempest, appeared<br>
to be trying to escape from their dismal <br>
environment and take the chance of finding <br>
a better one out at sea. The house was a <br>
two-story brick structure with a tower, a<br>
story higher, at one corner. In a window<br>
of that was the only visible light.<br>
Something in the appearance of the<br>
place made me shudder, a performance<br>
that may have been assisted by a rill<br>
of rainwater down my back as I scuttled<br>
to cover in the doorway. In answer to <br>
my note apprising him of my wish to call,<br>
Dampier had written, 'Don't ring -<br>
open the door and come up.' I did <br>
so. The staircase was dimly lighted<br>
by a single gas-jet at the top of the <br>
second flight. I managed to reach the <br>
landing without disaster and entered by an<br>
open door into the lighted square room of<br>
the tower. Dampier came forward in gown and<br>
slippers to receive me, giving me the greeting<br>
that I wished, and if I had held a thought<br>
that it might more fitly have been accorded me <br>
at the front door the first look at him dispelled <br>
any sense of his inhospitality. He was <br>
not the same. Hardly past middle age, he <br>
had gone grey and had acquired a pronounced <br>
stoop. His figure was thin and angular, his face<br>
 deeply lined, his complexion dead-white, <br>
 without a touch of colour. His eyes, <br>
 unnaturally, glowed with a fire that was almost uncanny.<br>
mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and <br>
perilous faiths. He made daring incursions into the realm<br>
of the unreal without renouncing his residence in<br>
the partly surveyed and charted region of what <br>
we are pleased to call certitude. The night of <br>
