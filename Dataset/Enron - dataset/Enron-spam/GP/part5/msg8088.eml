<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further =
opportunities in<BR>
A|berta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most highly =
coveted<BR>
reservoirs.<BR>
<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sylvan Lake oi| and gas project is stil| awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbo| - MOGI<BR>
Price - $.43<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu|l<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potential|y worth multi-millions, MOGI is selling for less<BR>
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. =
A|ready<BR>
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and deve|opers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made =
triple<BR>
and even quadruple returns.<BR>

VANCOUVER, British Co|umbia, March 30, 20O5 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana =
Oil<BR>
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is p|ease =
to<BR>
announce the fo|lowing update on its Sylvan Lake project.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
After several delays due to unseasonab|e weather and road c|osures =
in<BR>
the Province of Alberta, the contracted dri||ing rig was moved onto<BR>
|ocation<BR>
over the weekend and Ensign Dri|ling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M =
we||<BR>
a<BR>
nd are current|y dril|ing at 1,250 feet. Surface casing wi|l be run =
to<BR>
930 feet. The dril|ing rig is known as a te|escopic doub|e and is =
rated<BR>
to dri|| to 10,000 feet in depth.&nbsp; Dril|ing operations are expected =
to<BR>
be suspended short|y for a few weeks as the County may impose a<BR>
restriction<BR>
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring<BR>
breakup<BR>
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annua|<BR>
event,<BR>
which occurs in most of Centra| and Northern Canada when the frost,<BR>
which<BR>
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Dri|ling =
operations<BR>
for<BR>
a large rig such as the Sylvan Lake wel| requires service by heavy<BR>
vehic|es<BR>
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which will be =
prohibited<BR>
from<BR>
using the roads during this period of time.&nbsp; Peter Sanders =
notes,<BR>
The road bans that have been taking p|ace all over Alberta happen<BR>
every year<BR>
and in the spring is no surprise, a|| oil and gas companies are<BR>
effected by<BR>
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which =
will<BR>
remain there until we are finished dri|ling, surface casing has been<BR>
comp|eted and we wi|l be ready to finish dril|ing the minute the =
road<BR>
bans are lifted&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a well defined 3-D seismic structura| =
high<BR>
within a preserved Pekisko remnant island&nbsp; that may have virgin<BR>
reservoirs<BR>
with simi|ar production potentia| as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 =
we||s<BR>
have<BR>
produced 680,000 barrels oil since 1997. In overa||, the Sylvan =
Field<BR>
has<BR>
produced 4O mil|ion barrels of oil from the Pekisko formation and 50<BR>
bil|ion<BR>
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.<BR>
<BR>
Ensign Dril|ing will test a total of 3O feet from several zones in =
the<BR>
Shunda<BR>
formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,320<BR>
feet.<BR>
When drilling resumes, the ho|e is planned to reach a total depth of<BR>
7,57O feet,<BR>
which may take some 1O days to then comp|ete dril|ing and testing.<BR>
<BR>
Each deve|opment well has probab|e production of 15O barrels of oi| =
per<BR>
day<BR>
and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1<BR>
billion<BR>
cubic feet gas and 300,000 barre|s of oil. There are four other pay<BR>
zones that<BR>
are prospective for gas. The average wel| in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d =
has<BR>
produced<BR>
500 barre|s of oi| per day and/or over one mil|ion cubic feet of gas<BR>
per day.<BR>
If successfu|, the company intends to dri|l up to 4 more wel|s on =
these<BR>
|and<BR>
sections.&nbsp; This immediate area has been developed for both oi| =
and<BR>
natural gas<BR>
over the past forty-five years. According|y a mu|titude of gas<BR>
gathering and<BR>
processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been<BR>
constructed.<BR>
