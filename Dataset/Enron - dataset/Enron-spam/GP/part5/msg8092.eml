<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oi| and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|l market,<BR>
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US &quot;Oi| =
Be|t&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Mi||ions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas<BR>
Providing 0pp0rtunity<BR>
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and =
Large<BR>
Recoverab|e Reserves<BR>
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and =
drilled<BR>
by major oil companies<BR>
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantia| recoverab|e<BR>
reserves, estimated at over<BR>
3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in =
the<BR>
two pay zones.<BR>
<BR>
Symbol - EOGI<BR>
Price&nbsp;&nbsp; - .075<BR>
<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bull<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<BR>
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and<BR>
even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to =
underva|ued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|l =
company<BR>
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But a|l that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive<BR>
effect on the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or<BR>
decline<BR>
slightly, you wi|| sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings<BR>
wi||<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and<BR>
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive<BR>
production.<BR>
Ear|y investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news =
in<BR>
this<BR>
area wil| rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bu|letin.<BR>
