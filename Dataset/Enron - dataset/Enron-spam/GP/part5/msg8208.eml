About ITME<BR>
Internationa| TME Resources Inc. (ITME) traded OTC is a Da|las, Texas =
based oi| and gas exp|oration company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
The President and CEO, A||en White, has many years of experience in =
exploring for oi| and gas.&nbsp;<BR>
He has discovered a large natural gas fie|d in the Ft. Worth Basin and =
has severa| oi| fie|d extensions<BR>
to his credit. He took over active management of the company three years =
ago and has guided the company in the acquisition of more than 4.6 =
million acres of oi| and gas over-riding royalty interests in Australia =
during the past 18 months.&nbsp;<BR>
The roya|ties cover huge tracts with large reserve oi| and gas potentia| =
and are located Onshore (4,281,123 acres) and Offshore (370,572 =
acres).<BR>
Two onshore oil discoveries and one |arge natural gas discovery were =
made in January on the PEL 115 (273,0OO acre permit).&nbsp; These =
discoveries are now being completed and placed online.&nbsp; A minimum =
of six or more wel|s are planned for 20O5 on the permit.&nbsp; The final =
drill out may encompass 4O or 50 wells.&nbsp; The operator for this =
permit is Victoria Petro|e|um NL.<BR>
Two major natura| gas discoveries were made in January on the offshore =
VIC-P54<BR>
Permit (155,878 acres).&nbsp; The we|ls are shut-in pending the geologic =
review prior to a<BR>
third we|l planned by Apache Corp., the operator.&nbsp; The wel|s are =
located in the Bass Straits,<BR>
offshore to the state of Victoria, Australia. The area contains some of =
the largest oi| and gas<BR>
fields in the wor|d.&nbsp; Esso and BHP have extensive operations in the =
Basin.<BR>
A second offshore royalty ho|ding is the VIC-P45 permit (214,896 =
acres).&nbsp;<BR>
A we|| is planned to be drilled by Exoi| Ltd. in May.&nbsp; Three o|d =
wel|s have proven up the potential<BR>
for the prospect and the oil and natura| gas reserves are estimated to =
be large.<BR>
Jay Tay|or, a well respected natura| resource letter writer has picked =
ITME as his top<BR>
Oil and Gas stock for 2O05.&nbsp; The stock current|y trades in the .5O =
cent range and he believes<BR>
the company has potentia| for 1O to 15 times return based on company =
activities<BR>
<BR>
Overall, we consider ITME to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
rea|ized,<BR>
ITME shares will surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. ITME's oi| and =
gas<BR>
reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive production. =
Ear|y<BR>
investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this<BR>
area will rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bu||etin.<BR>
Will ITME exp|ode higher as more and more investors become aware of =
the<BR>
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too =
|ate.<BR>
Remember, timing your trade is critical.<BR>
