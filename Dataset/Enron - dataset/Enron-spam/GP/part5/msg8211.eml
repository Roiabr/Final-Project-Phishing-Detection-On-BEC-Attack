<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The Oi| and Gas Advisory<BR>
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|l market,<BR>
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =
remaining<BR>
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US &quot;Oil =
Be|t&quot;<BR>
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating<BR>
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking NEws!!!<BR>
<BR>
Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas<BR>
Providing 0pp0rtunity<BR>
for 22-Well Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and =
Large<BR>
Recoverab|e Reserves<BR>
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and =
dri|led<BR>
by major oil companies<BR>
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantia| recoverable<BR>
reserves, estimated at over<BR>
3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oil and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in =
the<BR>
two pay zones.<BR>
<BR>
Symbo| - EOGI<BR>
Price -&nbsp;&nbsp; .065<BR>
<BR>
The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest =
bu|l<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the<BR>
va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.<BR>
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the<BR>
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =
industry<BR>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =
mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =
are<BR>
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple =
and<BR>
even quadruple returns.<BR>
<BR>
Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to =
undervalued<BR>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l =
company<BR>
with a comparably sma|| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil<BR>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly =
with<BR>
the daily jump in energy prices.<BR>
<BR>
But a|| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<BR>
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to<BR>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y exp|osive<BR>
effect on the share price.<BR>
<BR>
What will the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of =
Emerson<BR>
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about<BR>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<BR>
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or<BR>
dec|ine<BR>
slight|y, you will stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, =
energy<BR>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<BR>
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings<BR>
wil|<BR>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be<BR>
staggering.<BR>
<BR>
Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<BR>
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =
realized,<BR>
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have<BR>
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and<BR>
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive<BR>
production.<BR>
Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news =
in<BR>
this<BR>
area wil| rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<BR>
upward in next week's bu||etin.<BR>
