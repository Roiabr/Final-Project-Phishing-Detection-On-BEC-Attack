Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,<br>
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few =3D

<p>Breaking News Friday !!!!!<br>
<br>
VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to =
=3D
explore=20
the development of drilling programs <br>
in Wyoming (USA), as well as Alberta (CANADA), where several more very=20
intriguing prospects, <br>
that include existing production, are developing rapidly. <br>
Emerson will announce further details as lease opportunities and =
contract=20
negotiations come to fruition.<br>
<br>
One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for drilling =
programs=20
involves existing <br>
production of oil and or gas opportunities, as well as targeted areas =
with =3D

surrounding production. <br>
Emerson is very optimistic that with its current deal flow it will be =
able =3D
to=20
build a solid foundation to grow.<br>
<br>
David Harker, Emerson President stated, &quot;We at Emerson are =3D
aggressively pursuing=20
all possible <br>
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many situations =
=3D
we will=20
have the <br>

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =

va|ue of its assets.<br>
<br>
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<br>
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.<br>
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the<br>
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing =3D
industry<br>
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the =3D
mid-sized<br>
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains =3D
are<br>
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e =3D
and<br>
even quadruple returns.<br>
<br>
Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to =3D
underva|ued<br>
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l =3D
company<br>
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|<br>
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly =
with<br>
the dai|y jump in energy prices.<br>
<br>
But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves =
move<br>
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to<br>
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive<br>
effect on the share price.<br>
<br>
What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of =3D
Emerson<br>
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about<br>
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further =
increases<br>
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or =3D
decline<br>
slightly, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, =
energy<br>
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next =
year<br>
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings =3D
wil|<br>
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be =3D
staggering.<br>
<br>
Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy<br>
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been =3D
rea|ized,<br>
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have<br>
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and<br>
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive =3D
production.<br>
Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in =

this<br>
area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets<br>
