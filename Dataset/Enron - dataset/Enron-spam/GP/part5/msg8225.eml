REPLY destiny121212121@netscape.net<BR>
I am Mr.Srichai pope, credit officer of Win Hang Bank Ltd. I have an =
urgent and<BR>
very<BR>
confidential business proposition for you.<BR>
On August 6, 1999, a British consultant/contractor with the Chinese =
Solid Minerals<BR>
Corporation, Mr. Philip Brian a British citizen made a numbered time =
(Fixed)Deposit<BR>
for twelve calendar months, valued at US$38,000,000.00 (Thirty-eight =
Million<BR>
<BR>
Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent aroutine notification =
to his<BR>
forwarding address but got no reply.<BR>
<BR>
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his =
contract<BR>
employers, the Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Philip =
Brian died from<BR>
a boat mishap. On further investigation,I found out that he died without =
making a<BR>
WILL, and all attempts totrace his next of kin was fruitless. I =
therefore made<BR>
further investigation and discovered that Mr. Philip Brian did not =
declare any kin or<BR>
relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit =
paperwork in my<BR>
Bank. This sum of US$38,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the =
interest is<BR>
being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one =
will ever<BR>
come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the =
expiration of 5<BR>
(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong =
Kong<BR>
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.<BR>
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to =
stand in as the<BR>
next of kin to Mr. Philip Brian so that the fruits of this old man's =
labor will not get<BR>
into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple, I =
will like you to<BR>
provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney =
will prepare<BR>
the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the =
next of<BR>
kin.<BR>
<BR>
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of =
65% for me<BR>
and 30% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the =
transaction .<BR>
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will =
be done by the<BR>
attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the =
successful<BR>
execution of this transaction.<BR>
If you are interested, please reply immediately to my e-Mail<BR>
box.destiny121212121@netscape.net<BR>
<BR>
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and =
relevant<BR>
documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please send me =
your<BR>
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. You =
should<BR>
observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction =
would be<BR>
most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance =
to invest my<BR>
share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply.<BR>
Sincerely<BR>
Mr.Srichai pope.<BR>
