RE:&nbsp; PLane CRASH of 31st of October 1999<BR>
<BR>
I am MR&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank Fido, the Director of Delivery/Operations in =
a<BR>
security company here in South Africa. Our firm is a security company of =
high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa =
especially top government officials and military leaders here in Africa. =
I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business =
proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I have not =
discussed this transaction with anybody because it is of top ecret.<BR>
<BR>
To be explicit and straight to the point, Some time early 1997, a<BR>
reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's<BR>
vault for safe keeping. And since then our client has failed to come =
forward to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a considerable =
amount of money in demurrage. Consequently, in our bid to contact this =
client to redeem his consignment to prevent more accumulation of =
Demurrage, we discovered that our client was Engineer Robert Fitzpatrick =
who worked for a Multinational company in Europe and&nbsp; On the 31st =
of October 1999, He and his wife&nbsp; were involved in a Plane crash on =
board Egyptian Boeing 767 from America that crashed into&nbsp; the =
Atlantic Ocean off the Massachusetts coast early Sunday morning, about =
half an hour after leaving New York's&nbsp; JF Kennedy International =
Airport( see website for details)<BR>
<A =
HREF=3D"http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html">http:/=
/www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html</A><BR>
<BR>
Since the death of our client Engineer Robert Fitzpatrick, none of =
his<BR>
benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us, which<BR>
means that non of his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this<BR>
consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly Scan the box =
that our client deposited in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered =
that the two boxes that were registered as treasures by our client =
actually contained a considerable amount of money in United States =
Dollars estimated to be over US$15million US Dollar. Since this =
development I have been nursing plans secretly.<BR>
<BR>
My investigation revealed that&nbsp; Late Mr FitzPatrick&nbsp; had the =
intention of establishing an oil drilling/Engineering firm in Africa and =
was moving saving the Money for that purpose.<BR>
<BR>
. It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the =
money that our client intended for use for realize his ambitions.Now =
that he is dead there is no trace to this money in our care. I am now =
soliciting your noble assistance to in transferring this money out of =
South Africa to your country for immediate investment with your =
assistance.<BR>
<BR>
I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 40% of =
the<BR>
total amount. Upon my receipt of your reply confirming your =
willingness<BR>
to assist me in this transaction, I will immediately arrange and ransfer =
all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to =
facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to =
your country for onwards investment. This transaction is 100% risk free. =
Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter.<BR>
<BR>
I await your most prompt response.<BR>
<BR>
Yours faithfully.<BR>
<BR>
