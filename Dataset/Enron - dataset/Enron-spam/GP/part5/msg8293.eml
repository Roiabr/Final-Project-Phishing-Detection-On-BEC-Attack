Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
My name is SALIM IBRAHIM a merchant in Dubai, in<BR>
the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer<BR>
<BR>
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and<BR>
right now I have only about a few months to live,<BR>
according to medical experts.<BR>
<BR>
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I<BR>
never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my<BR>
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,<BR>
I was always hostile to people and only focused on my<BR>
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But<BR>
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more<BR>
to life than just wanting to have<BR>
or make all the money in the world.<BR>
<BR>
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to<BR>
this world I would live my life a different way from<BR>
how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I<BR>
have willed and given most of my property and assets<BR>
to my immediate and extended family members as well as<BR>
a few close friends.<BR>
<BR>
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so,<BR>
I have decided to give also to charity<BR>
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last<BR>
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed<BR>
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,<BR>
Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has<BR>
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself<BR>
anymore.<BR>
<BR>
I once asked members of my family to close<BR>
one of my accounts and distribute the money which I<BR>
have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and<BR>
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to<BR>
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as<BR>
they seem not to be contended with what I have left<BR>
for them.<BR>
<BR>
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge<BR>
cash deposit of (Twenty million five hundred thousand u.sdollars)<BR>
that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want<BR>
you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity<BR>
organizations.<BR>
<BR>
I have set aside 15% for you.<BR>
<BR>
God be with you.<BR>
<BR>
