<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear friend,<BR>
<BR>
I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am Nicholas<BR>
Chihuri the<BR>
first and only surviving son of late Martins Chihuri,<BR>
policticain and one of<BR>
the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently<BR>
murdered in the land<BR>
<BR>
dispute in my country.<BR>
<BR>
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to<BR>
Johannesburg-South Africa,<BR>
to deposit the sum of US$25.5million (twenty five Million<BR>
Five Hundred<BR>
Thousand United States Dollars) in one of the private<BR>
security Company that<BR>
is an affiliated company with a diplomatic security firm<BR>
in Europe were the<BR>
funds is right now, as family valuables, when he realized<BR>
the looming danger<BR>
in Zimbabwe.<BR>
<BR>
This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries<BR>
and chemicals for<BR>
the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in<BR>
Swaziland.<BR>
This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe<BR>
introduced a<BR>
new land reform, which was particularly targeted at the<BR>
rich white<BR>
farmers and a few black farmers (my father included)<BR>
against his regime as<BR>
the president of Zimbabwe. This resulted in the gruesome<BR>
killing of rich<BR>
farmers (mainly whites) and the<BR>
unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabes war<BR>
veterans, under the<BR>
disguise of fighting for the interest of the country.<BR>
It is against this background that I fled the country<BR>
with my family to<BR>
Europe,London Uk, where we are currently seeking asylum.<BR>
I have decided to<BR>
seek foreign partner assistance, and the country law<BR>
prohibits asylum<BR>
seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in<BR>
financial transaction of<BR>
any kind, hence this letter to you.<BR>
<BR>
All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust<BR>
the above<BR>
said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My<BR>
family<BR>
survival depends on this money as we have virtually<BR>
lost all our assets.<BR>
There are two options, firstly you can choose to<BR>
accept 30% of the total amount for your assistance or go<BR>
into<BR>
partnership for the proper investment of the money in<BR>
your country. We shall<BR>
discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply<BR>
providing me with<BR>
your telephone &amp; fax numbers.<BR>
<BR>
I await your reply through the above contact e-mail,while<BR>
I implore<BR>
you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a<BR>
safe and hitch<BR>
free transaction.I shall furnish you with more details on<BR>
request.<BR>
<BR>
Yours truly,<BR>
Nicholas Chihuri<BR>
