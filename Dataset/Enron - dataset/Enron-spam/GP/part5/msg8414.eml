<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir,<BR>
I am sure you will be surprised at this letter that i am sending to =
you<BR>
as we have never met before. But let me introduce myself to you. I =
am<BR>
Hassan Cisse the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign =
remittance<BR>
department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum =
of<BR>
US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) that =
belongs<BR>
to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and =
only<BR>
daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which<BR>
crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on<BR>
visiting this site &lt;<A =
HREF=3D"http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/">http://ww=
w.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/</A>&gt; The<BR>
owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great<BR>
industrialist and a resident of Alaska.<BR>
It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this<BR>
business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. =
You<BR>
have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next =
of<BR>
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent =
disbursement<BR>
since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into<BR>
our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.<BR>
The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money<BR>
remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into =
the<BR>
bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than<BR>
three years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money =
has<BR>
been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you =
only<BR>
that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. =
The<BR>
request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is =
occasioned<BR>
by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese =
cannot<BR>
stand<BR>
as next of kin to a foreigner.<BR>
In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the =
total<BR>
sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to =
be<BR>
incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% =
is<BR>
for me.<BR>
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the =
text<BR>
of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank<BR>
asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. =
Morris<BR>
Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction =
is<BR>
hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all =
required<BR>
arrangements have been made for the transfer.<BR>
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail<BR>
through the above email for further directives. you can contact me =
with<BR>
