November 12, 2004: Avalon Gold Corporation (OTC BB: AVGC) announces it =
has entered
into an agreement with Golden Spirit Mining Ltd. (OTC BB: GSML) to sell =
a 40%
working interest in a giant gas field lease in the Uinta Basin, located =
in the US
Rockies, Utah.   Upon signing of the agreement, Golden Spirit will issue =
1,000,000
common shares 144-Registered as a non-refundable deposit to Avalon.  =
Golden Spirit
has a right to acquire the 40% working interest in the gas lease upon =
Avalon
receiving a payment of US$750,000 on or before December 10, 2004.   In =
return,
Avalon will issue and deliver 2,000,000 shares of its common stock to =
Golden Spirit.

The lease area, located in the Uinta Basin,  comprises 13,189 acres with =
a potential
4 TCF recoverable gas and is overpressured by a 0.55 - 0.85 gradient.

=20

According to available data in the area, the prospect property has been =
delineated
using several hundred miles of seismic.  The seismic data confirms the =
thick Emery
pay section and shows several sediment wedges in the prospect area.  "We =
feel the
data supports a basin wide deep gas accumulation covering the entire =
field," states
Robert Waters, President of Avalon Gold.  This giant gas lease borders =
other leases
owned by EOG Resources Inc. (NYSE: EOG) and EnCana Corp (TSE: ECA.TO; =
NYSE: ECA).

=20

Major energy companies today recognize that tight gas reservoirs, where =
geological
formations make production complex, and coal-bed methane, where gas is =
extracted
from coal deposits, are two of the more important near term sources to =
boost North
American production of natural gas as demand outstrips supply and drives =
up prices.

=20

The US Geological Survey estimated (in 1995) basin-center and deep-basin =
gas
resources in the Rocky Mountain Laramide basins to be 250 TCF.  The =
Drunkards Wash
Field, just south of the prospect area is estimated to have between 2-4 =
TCF of
recoverable gas.  The Jonah Field Overpressured Gas Plain, which is =
analogous to our
prospect area, has similar overpressuring, depth, reservoir rocks and is =
estimated
to be 2.5+ TCF.
