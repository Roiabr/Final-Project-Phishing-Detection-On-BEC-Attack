&quot;I Love Your Product!!!<BR>
<BR>
I have smoked for 40+ years, and I quit cold turkey.<BR>
Basically, I took Final Smoke, and a couple of hours later tried<BR>
to smoke a cigarette. But I was absolutely sick from it!<BR>
I now can keep up &amp; enjoy my grandchildren without coughing &amp; =
wheezing!!<BR>
Thank You!!!&quot; - Mary T. Goddard, KS<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This system works!!! I've wanted to quit smoking for some time =
now,<BR>
but the physical cravings always kept me back; but with this system,<BR>
my cravings were gone, and now so is my awful habit!!&quot; - Kai E. =

<BR>
&quot;I was skeptical when I ordered your product.<BR>
I was a smoker for 32 years and had tried EVERYTHING. On April 17th<BR>
at 12:00pm, I finished my last cigarette in my LAST pack. After taking =
the first 2 pills,<BR>
I have not touched another cigarette. On March 15, 1991 I turned 35 =
years old.<BR>
6 days later I had a severe heart attack. After in the hospital for 9 =
days I walked<BR>
out and started smoking again. I sat with my dad for a year till he died =
of Lung<BR>
Cancer in 1997 and I still smoked even as I watched him waste away.<BR>
Until I started Fina lSmoke I felt that within 5 years I'd be dead and =
gone.<BR>
But now I FEEL ALIVE again. More energy and even happier than I have =
been in years.<BR>
And I owe it all to you and your great product. You have changed my life =
forever<BR>
and for that I can never repay you. Thank You.&quot; - Ronnie Davenport =

&quot;Exactly What I Needed...&quot; This is a great system! I knew =
cigarettes were packed<BR>
with poisons but I didn't know just how many or what kind there =
were!<BR>
The Final Smoke capsules were the best. Every time I lit up a =
cigarette,<BR>
I threw it away before half of it was smoked, usually only 2-3 =
puffs.<BR>
It made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons!<BR>
This is exactly what I needed to help me stop! I've been trying<BR>
to quit for the past 7 years, I tried everything under the sun with no =
results.<BR>
With Final Smoke I was smoke free in under a month!&quot; - E. Okamura, =
