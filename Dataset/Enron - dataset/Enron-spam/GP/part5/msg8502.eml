invaluable to the mission: fellow adventurer and Virgin Atlantic chief =
Sir Richard Branson and aircraft designer Burt Rutan, whose plane =
Voyager launched brother Dick Rutan and co-pilot Jeana Yeager around the =
world without refueling in 1986.In addition, NASA imposed its own =
restrictions, including limiting launches to daylight hours -- at least =
for the first two test flights -- so that any falling debris from the =
