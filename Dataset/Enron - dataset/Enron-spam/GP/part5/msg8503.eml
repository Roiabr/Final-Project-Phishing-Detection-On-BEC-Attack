The same bridge saw another sight in the seventeenth century. Mr. =
Thomson, the &quot;curat&quot; of Anstruther Easter, was a man highly =
obnoxious to the devout: in the first place, because he was a =
&quot;curat&quot;; in the second place, because he was a person of =
irregular and scandalous life; and in the third place, because he was =
generally suspected of dealings with the Enemy of Man. These three =
disqualifications, in the popular literature of the time, go hand in =
hand; but the end of Mr. Thomson was a thing quite by itself, and in the =
proper see, a manifest judgment. He had been at a see's house in =
Anstruther Wester, where (and elsewhere, I suspect) he had partaken of =
the bottle; indeed, to put the thing in our cold modern way, the =
reverend gentleman was on the brink of DELIRIUM TREMENS. It was a dark =
night, it seems; a little lassie came carrying a lantern to fetch the =
curate home; and away they went down the street of Anstruther Wester, =
the lantern swinging a bit in the child's hand, the barred lustre =
tossing up and down along the front of slumbering houses, and Mr. =
Thomson not altogether steady on his legs nor (to all appearance) easy =
in his mind. The pair had reached the middle of the bridge when (as I =
conceive the scene) the poor tippler started in some baseless fear and =
looked behind him; the child, already shaken by the minister's strange =
behaviour, started also; in so doing, she would jerk the lantern; and =
for the space of a moment the lights and the shadows would be all =
confounded. Then it was that to the unhinged toper and the twittering =
child, a huge bulk of blackness seemed to sweep down, to pass them close =
by as they stood upon the bridge, and to vanish on the farther side in =
the general darkness of the night. &quot;Plainly the devil come for Mr. =
Thomson!&quot; thought the child. What Mr. Thomson thought himself, we =
have no ground of knowledge; but he fell upon his knees in the midst of =
the bridge like a man praying. On the rest of the journey to the manse, =
history is silent; but when they came to the door, the poor caitiff, =
taking the lantern from the child, looked upon her with so lost a =
countenance that her little courage died within her, and she fled home =
screaming to her parents. Not a soul would venture out; all that night, =
the minister dwelt alone with his terrors in the manse; and when the day =
dawned, and men made bold to go about the streets, they found the devil =
had come indeed for Mr. Thomson.<BR>
