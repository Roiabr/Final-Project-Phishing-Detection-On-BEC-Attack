<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We sent you an email a while ago, because you now qualify<BR>
for a much lower rate based on the biggest rate drop in years.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You can now get $250,000 for as little as $515 a month!<BR>
Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Follow this link to process your application and a 24 hour approval:<BR>
