I must have women -- there is nothing unbends the mind like them.<BR>All =
fair in love and war.Much violence is based on the illusion that life is =
a property to be defended and not to be shared.<br>Life is not a problem =
to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.



<BR>Our thoughts take the wildest flight: Even at the moment when they =
should arrange themselves in thoughtful order.<br>Kids use to ask where =
they came from, now they tell you where to go



<br><br>I don't want to do business with those who don't make a profit, =
because they can't give the best service.

<BR><BR>The liberals can understand everything but people who don't =
understand them.



<br>A lie can run around the world six times while the truth is still =
trying to put on its pants.Beware of no man more than of yourself we =
carry our worst enemies within us.


<br>Death, so called, is a thing which makes men weep, and yet a third =
of life is passed in sleep.

<BR><BR>Rest not. Life is sweeping by go and dare before you die. =
Something mighty and sublime, leave behind to conquer time.


<br>Listen! Encourage. Say something. Do something. Be yourself. =
Love<BR><BR>A man who gives his children habits of industry provides for =
them better than by giving them a fortune.



<br>Getting divorced just because you don't love a man is almost as =
silly as getting married just because you do.<BR>Force without forecast =
is to little avail.



The problems of this world are only truly solved in two ways: by =
extinction or duplication.

<br><br>Our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how =
anybody or anything outside ourselves will affect us.<BR><BR><A =
