For what human ill does dawn not seem to be alternative?<br><br>There =
can't be a crisis next week. My schedule is already full.

<br><br>A gift consists not in what is done or given, but in the =
intention of the giver or doer.



<br>That is never too often repeated, which is never sufficiently =
learned.

<br>He who fears being conquered is sure of defeat.

<br><br>If I seem to boast more than is becoming, my excuse is that I =
brag for humanity rather than for myself.<BR><BR>We are twice armed if =
we fight with faith.
<br><br>Charity creates a multitude of sins.Always seek out the seed of =
triumph in every adversity.



<br><br>Our deeds determine us, as much as we determine our deeds.



To doubt is worse than to have lost And to despair is but to antedate =
those miseries that must fall on us.
<br>The first day, a guest the second, a burden the third, a =
pest.<BR><BR>My age is as a lusty winter, frosty but kindly.<BR>Some =
fellows get credit for being conservative when they are only stupid.



People who do not know how to laugh are always pompous and =
self-conceited.


<br><br>Chaos in the midst of chaos isn't funny, but chaos in the midst =
of order is.<br>Successful men follow the same advice they prescribe for =
others.



<br>A single bad habit will mar an otherwise faultless character, as an =
ink-drop soileth the pure white page.
