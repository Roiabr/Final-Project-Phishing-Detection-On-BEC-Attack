<BR>Oh, that one could learn to learn in time!



<BR>The only prudence in life is concentration.



<br><br>Luxury ruins republics poverty, monarchies.
<br>If you continually give, you will continually have.

dream I will make it, I won't even get close.<BR><BR>Curious things, =
habits. People themselves never knew they had them.<br>Fear of change =
perplexes monarchs.<br>Common Sense is that which judges the things =
given to it by other senses.<BR><BR><A =
