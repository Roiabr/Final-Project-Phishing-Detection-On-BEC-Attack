Possibilty  of  an  Absolutely  Huge Week as Massive PR Campaign has
started and is Expected to Last All Week.<p><p>


Imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so
if you had the scoop on the following stock:<p>

(OTCBB:  MBAH):This  stock  closed  at   .01  on September 1st. This
Little Giant closed at   .06  on  October  8th,  up  500% in about 5
weeks. Do You Think IBM is Going to Move Like That Anytime Soon?<p>

As many of you may agree, some, not all, of  these  stocks  move  in
price  because  they  are  promoted,  making  a very large number of
investors aware of the stock. The awareness is underway on DMXP!<p><p>


Let's Look  at  The  Company,  Delta  Mining  and  Exploration Corp.
OTC:DMXP<p>

About The Company:<p>

Delta Mining and Exploration Corp. OTC:DMXP is a mineral exploration
company  that   controls   6   properties   totaling   7,554   acres
(approximately  11  sq.  miles)  in Montana.  The properties are all
located over  what  management  considers  to  be  some  of the most
prospective  diamond  exploration  terrain  in  the  United  States.
Another 10,000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties  are
controlled  in  Bolivia,  South  America.  Initial work has revealed
that the  Bolivian  properties  display  similar  potential to those
found in North America.<p>

The management team is led by Chief  Executive  Officer,  Dr.  Barry
Rayment,  who  is experienced enough to take this junior exploration
company  to  the  next  level.   Dr.  Rayment  brings  32  years  of
experience in the field of  geology,  along with running some of the
most successful mining companies in the industry.  Dr.  Rayment  was
the  President  of  Bema  Gold  Corp., (AMEX: BGO), a company with a
market cap of close to  a  billion  dollars.  He was also affiliated
with Glamis Gold, Gold Fields Mining  and  Amselco  Exploration  (BP
Minerals),  among  others.  His vast experience in the mining sector
along with his extensive  knowledge  of  public companies will be an
extraordinary asset to Delta and its  shareholders  as  the  company
moves forward.<p>

Among the support team is Stephen Kay, a geologist with more than 30
years  experience  in  exploration  throughout Europe, South Africa,
South America and the United  States.  While with Gold Fields Mining
Corp., Stephen Kay was instrumental in the discovery and  subsequent
drilling of the 3 million ounce Mesquite gold deposit in California.<p>

Delta  has  experienced  significant  technical  success  since  its
start-up  in  1997.   For  example,  Delta  has discovered the first
in-situ  microdiamond  ever  found   in  Montana  on  its  Homestead
Kimberlite, southeast of Lewistown.  The Company also controls  part
of  the  Three Buttes Kimberlite where initial exploration has shown
The  Three  Buttes  Kimberlite  to  host  typical  diamond indicator
minerals - a major step toward  finding  the  presence  of  economic
diamonds - including pyrope (garnet), chromite and clinoprroxene.<p>

An  aggressive  regional  exploration  program  has the potential to
discover  additional   kimberlite   or   lamproite   pipes  in  this
under-explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing
kimberlites in Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada. <p>

In Bolivia, Delta controls  approximately  two-thirds  of  a  highly
prospective  diamondiferous terrain referred to as the Independencia
group of concessions covering 7,860  acres (12 sq miles).  The other
one-third is presently being explored by De Beers.  In  addition  to
the  Independencia  property  Delta  controls  more than 2,000 acres
comprising the highly attractive  Precambrian property that displays
all the  diamond  indicator  minerals  that  would  suggest  further
exploration is justified.<p>

Delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing
its  extensive  portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also
by acquiring additional  diamond  properties.   Delta  will focus on
identifying and developing strategic  alliances  with  major  mining
companies  as  well  as joint ventures to develop the properties and
finance additional exploration.<p>

In addition  to  the  highly  prospective  diamond  properties Delta
controls, they also control a gold property  with  great  potential.
The  property  is  near  La  Paz  in Bolivia, where initial analysis
revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an
extensive exploration program.<p><p>

Will  DMXP explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock this weekend and next  week?  If you think so, you may not
want to wait until it is too late. Remember, timing  your  trade  is
critical. Good Luck and Happy Trading.<p><p>
