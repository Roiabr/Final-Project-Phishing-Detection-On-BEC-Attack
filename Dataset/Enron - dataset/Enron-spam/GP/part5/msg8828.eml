Hi Paliourg<BR>
Are you tired of spam?<BR>
Your credit card details are spread through the internet?
<BR><BR>

Do you know that 95% of computers are now infected !<BR>
Pop-ups, commercial websites and software like KaZaa are massively =

<BR><BR>
 *Monitors your personal info (Chat Logs, Passwords, Emails, SSN)<BR>
 *Dramatically Slows Down your computer, until it crashes<BR>
 *Floods you with aggressive Pop-ups and Commercials<BR>
 *Hides on your PC un-revealed by Anti-Virus or Firewall Programs<BR>
 *Some cases even result in Credit Card Fraud or Identity Theft!<BR>
