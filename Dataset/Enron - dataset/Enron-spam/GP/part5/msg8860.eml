Recent News and Major Share-Price Driving Milestones:<BR>
<BR>
G.E.E.C.F just announced a 10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with several =
companies operated by the Chinese Government.<BR>
<BR>
G.E.E.C.F uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types =
of waste into clean, &quot;green&quot; electricity at 5 to 10 mega-watts =
per hour.<BR>
<BR>
G.E.E.C.F Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. Albert =
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Billion LineofCredit for G.E.E.C.F and opened =
doors in over a dozen countries through political contacts at the =
highest level.<BR>
<BR>
Sahara Petroleum Exploration Corp., a newly-formed, 100% wholly-owned =
Energy Division of G.E.E.C.F, just signed a &quot;Letter of =
Confidentiality and Non-Circumvention&quot; with Vetra Group AVV Corp. =
(Management incl. the former Pres. of OPEC and the President of Shell of =
Venezuela).<BR>
<BR>
Vetra Group is a major international Oil and Gas exploration and =
production super-powerhouse handling more than 900 industrial energy =
projects in 50 countries with over 50 of the largest oil super-majors in =
the world as their clients. There were no details given as to why a =
company of Vetra's power and status would initiate a business venture =
with the shell-like division of Sahara Petroleum. This is exactly how a =
potentially explosive partnership begins - completely unexpected with no =
hype or info about the oil-related business at hand. Reading between the =
lines, there is a deafening silence that something phenomenal is =
brewing.<BR>
<BR>
Conservative estimates value the G.E.E.C.F at<BR>
One Billion<BR>
<BR>
Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy<BR>
<BR>
G.E.E.C.F is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their =
Biosphere Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste =
products at 5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global =
waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process converts =
into clean, &quot;green&quot; electricity such waste materials as =
Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical =
wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, =
and the huge market of used tires.<BR>
G.E.E.C.F generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the =
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish =
the local or national grid.<BR>
<BR>
China's Aggressive Pursuit of G.E.E.C.F makes 2005 a =
&quot;Blue-Chip&quot; Year<BR>
<BR>
G.E.E.C.F just announced a 10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese =
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coal Mining (N.Y.S.E - =
YZC, 77.00). The deal is structured to have 1,300 G.E.E.C.F Biosphere =
Systems deployed throughout China to fulfill an urgent need for waste =
disposal and energy generation, two critical areas for a country with a =
population exceeding 1.3 billion people. As China's rapid economic =
advance continues, a shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually, =
prompting periodic blackouts in all Chinese Provinces. G.E.E.C.F is in =
line to profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable =
Municpal Solid Waste disposal and simultaneously helping China meet its =
energy needs.<BR>
<BR>
Future Milestones:<BR>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G.E.E.C.F had a 100 Million backlog of =

be deployed throughout the country.<BR>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G.E.E.C.F's present assets of 35 =
Million will conservatively jump into the 300 Million range, a 10-times =
increase.<BR>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G.E.E.C.F is in advanced stages of =
agreement on at least 6 major international projects which could add 50 =
Million to the bottom-line or 1.42 per share.<BR>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P/E on average for this Industry Group =
is 20 to 1 putting G.E.E.C.F above the 13.00 range without any future =
business expansion.<BR>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G.E.E.C.F is expected to file for a =
higher exchange listing and continue to pay common stock and spin-off =
stock dividends.<BR>
<BR>
Worldwide Market Potential<BR>
15 to 25 Billion over next 5 years with no other known company that can =
match their technology, leadership, or explosive sales growth.<BR>
<BR>
Up until now G.E.E.C.F has been one of Wall Street's best kept secrets, =
yet now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the release of =
this new Investor Awareness Campaign<BR>
should be excellent timing in regards to some new PR's forthcoming which =
will Rocket G.E.E.C.F. This power-play has nowhere to go but up, =
according to most insiders, and there's<BR>
still a bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor =
awareness and the anticipated release of huge news announcements will =
add to the buying frenzy from investors<BR>
loading up before G.E.E.C.F goes through the roof.<BR>
