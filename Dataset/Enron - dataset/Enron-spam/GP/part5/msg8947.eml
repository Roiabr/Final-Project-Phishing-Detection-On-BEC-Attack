Canadian  Oil  Sands   Extraction   Solution!  Sequoia's  DiamondFlo
Displaces Oil from Tar Sands in Lab Tests.<P>

Tuesday September 14, 10:55 am ET<P>

Here is an excerpt from that announcement:<P>

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS   WIRE)--Sept.   14,   2004--Sequoia    Interests
Corporation   (Pink   Sheets:SQNC   -  News),  developer  of  a  new
proprietary enhanced  oil  recovery  chemical  formulation,  is very
pleased to report the Company's DiamondFlo(TM) has  yielded  stellar
results  in  displacing  oil  from  Canadian  Tar  Sand  samples  in
laboratory tests. DiamondFlo(TM) displaced a significant quantity of
the  adhered  oil  from  tar sand samples in the initial feasibility
tests. Work is now  underway  to  define  the  precise degree of oil
removal  and   to   optimize   the   oil   removal   process   using
DiamondFlo(TM).<P>

The  Canadian  Tar Sands fields are recognized as the mother lode of
hydrocarbons on Earth. Conservative estimates of oil reserves in the
surrounding  area  of  Fort  McMurray,  Alberta,  Canada  total  1.6
trillion barrels of oil,  of  which  330  billion barrels of oil are
deemed recoverable. By comparison, Saudi Arabia has proven  reserves
of  262  billion  barrels of oil. A primary difficulty in developing
the Tar Sands region is extraction.  The  oil does not flow as crude
from other oil producing regions but is more akin to a molasses-like
sand. Separation of oil from the sands is  the  major  challenge  to
development.(Press Release Source:Sequoia Interests Corp.)<P><P>


What  if  a  company  had  a  product  that would allow oil wells to
produce much more oil?<P>

What would that stock be worth  with  today's oil prices close to 45
per barrel ?<P>

10, 20, 30, 100 dollars ? and now several of the major oil companies
are currently testing the product.  At  0.95  we  think  SQNC  is  a
homerun.<P><P>


About the Company: Sequoia Interests ( SQNC.PK)<P>

To  solve  this  problem,  the  oil  industry  is  looking  for  new
alternatives  for  increased  exploration  and production. The clear
solution for increased demand  and  consumption can already be found
in the ground, with nearly two thirds of oil left in the  ground  at
US  wells,  too  technically  complex  or  expensive to extract with
traditional technologies. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is an exciting
new frontier in the oil  and  gas industry which you are guar-anteed
to hear more of in the coming years. Typically, EOR involved  gasses
and  heat  to  stimulate oil flow and recover fluids in ground after
primary  and  secondary   production   has   ended,  but  these  EOR
technologies have proven to be cumbersome and costly.<P>

SQNC has already recei-ved strong interest from major  oil  and  gas
companies  for  testing and potential licensing of this product, and
is  in  the  final  stages   of  the  research  and  development  of
DiamondFlo. With testing expected to be completed in the next  60-90
days,  and  planned patent application shortly thereafter, we expect
major announcements from SQNC will  cause major price gains for this
stock over the coming  months!  What  is  more,  DiamondFlos  unique
chemical properties, make it an ideal solution for a number of other
application  in  the  oil  & gas industry, including remediation and
environmental  cleanup  of  oil   fields,  refineries,  and  storage
facilities- an estimated $8.1 billi0n market 0pportunity! With  this
revolutionary  product  in  the  development pipeline, SQNC has also
made some aggressive  moves  into  oil  and  gas production with its
recent  acquisition  of  leases  in  Pecos  Valley,   Texas.   These
operations  will act as a test-bed for development and validation of
the DiamondFlo product and provide  an additional revenue stream and
source of cash flow for SQNC.<P>

SQNC is one of the hottest investment opportunities we have seen  in
the  past year, and with commercialization of its DiamondFlo product
looming near, we feel that it  is  only a matter of time before Wall
Street recognizes this undervalued stock.  What  is  more,  SQNC  is
positioned  within  an  industry  that  has  seen  tremendous upside
growth, and is headed for  even  more appreciation as the global oil
crisis demands  new  production  solutions.  Over  the  last  twelve
months,  the  oil  well  services  &  equipment industry has seen an
average price gain of more than 88%, and savvy investors in emerging
companies have witnessed tremendous pr0fits. We believe that SQNC is
one of the  most  revolutionary  new  companies  on  the market, and
presents a money-making 0pportunity  that  cannot  be  missed.  With
major  announcements  stemming  from  the  completion  of R and D on
DiamondFlo, SQNC should make a nice move in the coming days.<P><P>


A Few Reasons to Own SQNC:<P>

1. With its  innovative  DiamondFlo  product,  SQNC is positioned to
help alleviate the impending oil  and  gas  crisis,  with  producers
struggling  to  keep  up  with growing US energy demands, as foreign
exploration  and  production  comes  under  increasing  geopolitical
pressures.  Increased  consumption  demands  have  combined  with an
increasingly unstable international  production  climate  to  create
some  of  the  highest  prices  seen at the pump since the 1970s oil
embargo, and crude  oil  prices  on  the  spot  market have recently
approached the $50 mark. As oil companies seek new ways to  maximize
domestic  oil  recovery, the chemical EOR approach of SQNC will be a
major factor in  increasing  production  and  removing dependence on
foreign oil.<P>

2. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) represents the logical next  step  in
expanding  domestic  oil production, and represents a tremendous and
presently underappreciated market potential.  Over two thirds of oil
in US reservoirs is left  unproduced  after  primary  and  secondary
production,  leaving an incredible and untapped source for US energy
needs. According  to  the  US  Department  of  Energy,  EOR  has the
potential to recover 35 billion barrels of oil, 50%  more  than  the
current  US  proven reserves of 23 billion barrels, and even greater
than the US estimated undiscovered  potential of 30 billion barrels.
With  its  DiamondFlo  chemical  EOR  solution,  SQNC   is   ideally
positioned  to benefit from a renewed focus on production from these
untapped oil reserves.<P>

3.  SQNC  has  developed   a  revolutionary  chemical  EOR  product,
DiamondFlo which offers tremendous advantages over thermal  and  gas
EOR  methods.  Thermal and gas (primarily CO2 injection to stimulate
production are costly  and  require  a complex infrastructure, while
other chemical  EOR  products  have  had  limited  success  and  are
environmentally  damaging.  By  contrast,  DiamondFlo is expected to
generate   recovery   of   20-40%    above   current   methods,   is
environmentally safe and meets strict regulatory standards  for  oil
recovery  and  remediation,  and will be available to producers at a
comparable price point to competitive products. With introduction of
DiamondFlo  to  the  market  following  completion  of  testing  and
development, SQNC is poised to  revolutionize the oil & gas industry
with this innovative approach to enhanced oil recovery.<P>

4. In addition to its principal application in EOR, SQNCs DiamondFlo
product  has  additional  applications  in  the  $8.7  oil  and  gas
remediation market.  During  the  testing  process,  DiamondFlo  has
demonstrated   exceptional   remediation   properties,  with  static
remediation tests  determining  that  it  removed  more  than 80% of
hydrocarbons from soil  with  no  significant  hydrocarbon  emulsion
(mixing of oil and water). This discovery paves the way for eventual
application  in  environmental  cleanup of oil facilities or spills,
and opens up  a  tremendous  new  market  for  SQNC. Since 1992, the
American Petroleum Industry estimates that over $90 billion has been
spend by the oil and gas industry to protect the  environment,  with
$8.7 billion spent annually in environmental expenditures.<P>

5.   Complimenting   its   primary  focus  on  the  development  and
commercialization of DiamondFlo, SQNC has  opened up a promising new
operation and revenue stream with its acquisition  of  oil  and  gas
leases  in  Pecos  Valley,  Texas.  SQNC  has  formed  a subsidiary,
NorthAmerican Energy Gr0up,  Inc.  to  focus  on the acquisition and
operation of leases with  proven  reserves  that  can  benefit  from
application  of  SQNCs  EOR  technologies.  These  acquisitions will
provide an additional revenue stream for SQNC, in addition to acting
as a test platform to validate the Companys DiamondFlo product. SQNC
has recently acquired a  110-acre  lease  in Pecos Valley, Texas and
intends to  pursue  additional  acquisition  0pportunities  as  they
arise.<P>

6.  SQNC benefits from its balanced and experienced executive senior
management and advisory team, who have a wealth of experience in the
oil and gas industry.  President  and  CEO  John  King has more than
twenty years of accounting and financial management with established
and  growth  companies,  specializing   in   contract   negotiation,
corporate  relocations,  tax  structure,  procedural  controls,  and
negotiation  of  cr-edit  terms.  CFO Robert Taylor has more than 23
years experience in financial management experience in the petroleum
industry, with  past  positions  including  VP  of  Operations for a
Fortune 500 service company; and VP of R and D Ron Knocke has been a
senior technical and management personnel in the petroleum  industry
with positions at Core Laboratories and NGPL, in addition to project
development  and  evaluation which have resulted in the discovery of
more than $125 milli0n in recoverable reserves.<P><P>
