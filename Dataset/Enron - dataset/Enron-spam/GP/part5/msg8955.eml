&gt;There are thousands hacking at the branches of evil to one who is =
striking at the root.<BR>
&gt;I must say, I don't feel very qualified to be a pop star. I feel =
very awkward at times in the role.<BR>
&gt;When the stomach is full, it is easy to talk of fasting.<BR>
&gt;I know not what course others may take but as for me, give me =
liberty, or give me death.<BR>
&gt;He who would acquire fame must not show himself afraid of censure. =
The dread of censure is the death of genius.<BR>
&gt;Classic art was the art of necessity: modern romantic art bears the =
stamp of caprice and chance.<BR>
&gt;He also who is slack in his work is brother to him who destroys. =
[Proverbs 18:9]<BR>
&gt;Perhaps in a book review it is not out of place to note that the =
safety of the state depends on cultivating the imagination.<BR>
&gt;These can never be true friends: Hope, dice, a prostitute, a robber, =
a cheat, a goldsmith, a monkey, a doctor, a distiller.<BR>
&gt;We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in =
a fit of absence of mind.<BR>
&gt;How easy it is to judge rightly after one sees what evil comes from =
judging wrongly!<BR>
&gt;The folly of all follies is to be love sick for a shadow.<BR>
&gt;Every man must do two things alone he must do his own believing and =
his own dying.<BR>
&gt;The art of creation is older than the art of killing.<BR>
&gt;Fortune makes a fool of those she favors too much.<BR>
&gt;Nobody speaks the truth when there's something they must have.<BR>
&gt;Desire is proof of the availability...<BR>
&gt;Joy is the feeling of grinning on the inside.<BR>
&gt;An aged man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick<BR>
