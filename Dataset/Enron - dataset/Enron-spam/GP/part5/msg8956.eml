&gt;There is no such thing as a moral dress. It's people who are moral =
or immoral.<BR>
&gt;Ultimately we know deeply that the other side of fear is a =
freedom.<BR>
&gt;I was street smart, but unfortunately the street was Rodeo =
Drive.<BR>
&gt;Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those =
who hustle.<BR>
&gt;Whenever books are burned men also in the end are burned.<BR>
&gt;Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to =
do, something to love, and something to hope for.<BR>
&gt;We know what happens to people who stay in the middle of the road. =
They get run over.<BR>
&gt;Love wholeheartedly, be surprised, give thanks and praise then you =
will discover the fullness of your life.<BR>
&gt;To betray you must first belong.<BR>
&gt;Frankly, I don't want to see a rapid upturn.&nbsp; I want it to hold =
until some of these idiotic competitors go bust.<BR>

least half imposed.<BR>

the situation.<BR>
&gt;He that is kind is free, though he is a slave he that is evil is a =
slave, though he be a king.<BR>
&gt;Under a tattered cloak you will generally find a good drinker.<BR>
&gt;No one wants advice, only corroboration.<BR>
