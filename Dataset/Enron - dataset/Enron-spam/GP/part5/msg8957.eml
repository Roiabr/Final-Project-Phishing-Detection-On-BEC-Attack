&gt;America once had the clarity of the pioneer ax.<BR>
&gt;Everywhere I have sought rest and not found it, except sitting in a =
corner by myself with a little book.<BR>
&gt;A vigorous temper is not altogether an evil. Men who are easy as an =
old shoe are generally of little worth.<BR>
&gt;No comment is a splendid expression. I am using it again and =
again.<BR>
&gt;Tomorrow, you promise yourself, will be different, yet, tomorrow is =
too often a repetition of today.<BR>
&gt;Colleges don't make fools, they only develop them.<BR>
&gt;This grandiose tragedy that we call modern art.<BR>
&gt;Some folks won't look up until they are flat on their backs<BR>
&gt;Under socialism all will govern in turn and will soon become =
accustomed to no one governing.<BR>
&gt;Christmas waves a magic wand over this world, and behold, everything =
is softer and more beautiful.<BR>
&gt;One cannot walk through an assembly factory and not feel that one is =
in Hell.<BR>
&gt;If an angel were ever to tell us anything of his philosophy I =
believe many propositions would sound like 2 times 2 equals 13.<BR>
&gt;A bore is a man who, when you ask him how he is, tells you.<BR>
&gt;A diplomat is a person who can tell you to go to hell in such a way =
that you actually look forward to the trip.<BR>
&gt;Nothing wilts faster than laurels that have been rested upon.<BR>
&gt;In the fight between you and the world, back the world.<BR>
&gt;The simple lack of her is more to me than others presence.<BR>
&gt;The best way to know God is to love many things.<BR>
&gt;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their =
dreams.<BR>
