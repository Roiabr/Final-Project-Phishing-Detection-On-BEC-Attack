Let's Look at Today's Featured Company, Frontier  Oil  and  Gas(OTC:
FOGL)<P>

Frontier Oil and Gas Ltd is a chance to operate a successful oil and
gas  production company.  This company through a 50/50 joint venture
with Fowlers Oil  and  Gas  will  be  penetrating  the market in the
business of natural gas and oil production.<P>

The vision of the company is to establish itself and develop a solid
foundation for future growth by developing properties that provide a
balance  of  short  and  long term reserves for both natural gas and
oil. The company will  establish  this through strategic development
partnerships and independently in the future. The company will  work
to  establish and maintain properties with potential for development
and drilling. The company emphasize will be on production, cash flow
and reserve value.<P>

Fowler Project<P>

Frontier Oil and  gas  brings  excellent  partners  to  the table in
Fowlers oil and gas. The company is looking to develop both oil  and
natural  gas reserves located in the Cook Inlet oil basin in Alaska.
Ownership of the 80  acres  property  located  in  the cook inlet is
owned free and clear by the fowler family for  the  last  45  years,
with  an  additional 7,000 adjacent acres to be leased. Well spacing
for the owned  property  will  be  one(1)  well for every twenty(20)
acres with the possibility of approval for a one(1) well per ten(10)
acres. Current Oil Reserve is an unproven reserve with an  estimated
2 billion barrels. Current Gas Reserve is a fully documented reserve
with  an estimated 1.9 trillion cubic feet. The development property
in question is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines.<P>

Corporate Vision<P>

Frontier is optimistic in regards to its successful participation in
an ever-growing share of the  oil  and gas marketplace. Frontier has
set definite objectives in order to achieve the companies set  goals
and  believes  that  there  are  several  key factors that will make
frontier successful.<P>

1) The Fowler project is lower  risk  then most oil and gas ventures
due to the following:<P>

The gas field is a proven reserve for Cook Inlet.<P>

Our land is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines.<P>

Capital needed for the extraction and transportation of the oil will
be internally generated by the gas revenue, and the ability to  sell
oil futures for physical delivery in 2-3 years.<P>
