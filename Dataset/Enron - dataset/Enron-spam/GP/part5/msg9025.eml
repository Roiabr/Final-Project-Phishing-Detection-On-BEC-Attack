Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
I will like to solicit your help in a business preposition, which is by =
nature very confidential and a Top Secret.<BR>
<BR>
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one worried =
and apprehensive but I am assuring you not to worry, as all will be well =
at the end of this endeavor.<BR>
<BR>
THE PROPOSITION<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr. Ola Obafemi ,Accountant General of the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK =
GROUP (ADBG)). I as the accounting officer of late Mr. Steven Mawyers,a =
national of your country, who used to work with Shell Petroleum =
Development Company(SPDC)in Nigeria.Until on the 21st of April 2003, my =
client,his wife and their only son were involved in a car accident along =
sagbama express road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost =
there lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to =
locate any of my clients<BR>
extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful.<BR>
<BR>
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to confide in your =
country's chamber of commerce to refer to me to any competent and viable =
person whom i can trsut to help me receive this funds,as i donot want =
the bank to confiscate this funds, hence I contacted you.I have =
contacted you to assist in repatriating the assets and Capital valued at =
US$10,550,000.00 (Ten million Five Hundred and Fifty thousand US =
dollars) left behind by my client before they get confiscated or =
declared unserviceable by the share holders of this bank ,so that they =
can share his funds as dividends amongst them selves.<BR>
<BR>
However,the said fund,US$10,550,000.00 (Ten million Five Hundred and =
Fifty thousand US dollars) ,has been transfered to a foreign finance =
bank outside Africa and the Bank has issued me a notice to provide the =
next-of-kin or have the account confiscated within the next fourteen =
official working days.<BR>
<BR>
Due to the fact that whenhe was alive until his demise I was his =
accountng officer ,but have since been promoted to the position of =
Executive Director,and ever since I have been unsuccessful in locating =
the relatives for some months now, I seek your consent to present you as =
the next of kin to the deceased only if i can trust you on this since =
you are a foreigner,so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to =
you.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we shall then discuss =
the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer. I have all necessary =
formation and legal documents needed to back you up for claim as the =
next-of-kin to the decaesed.<BR>
<BR>
All I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see this =
transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a =
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the =
law.<BR>
<BR>
I am waiting to hear from you soon.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
