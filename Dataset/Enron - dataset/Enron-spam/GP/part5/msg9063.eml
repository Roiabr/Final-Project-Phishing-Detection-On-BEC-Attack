About The Company:<br>
The primary objective of HPNG is to participate in specialty finance
within  the  public  and  private markets.  Hampden has partnerships
with finance and in  surance  companies to provide collateral backed
high yield short-term financing.<p>

Hampden is a unique  finance  company  that uses new technologies to
help  track  and  protect  loan  portfolio  assets.   The   use   of
sophisticated  tracking  technology significantly lowers the risk of
high yield lending and  allows  the  company  to benefit from unique
situations and under serviced investments.  In addition to  physical
asset  backed  lending, Hampden Grp. will  also actively participate
in  structured  financial  contracts  with  small  public  companies
through  PIPE  (private   investment  public  entity)  transactions.
Hampden plans to service private and small publicly traded companies
that have a need for short-term working capital  and  cannot  obtain
traditional financing.<p>

Hampden's  business  plan  provides  collateralized   financing   to
its  customers with annualized rates of return greater than 25%. The
company's valuation, financial  ratios, executive compensation, exit
strategy, and other management decisions are  driven  directly  from
the business plan.(Source: News Announcement 10/15/04)<p>

Will  HPNG explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too
late. Remember, timing your trade  is  critical. Good Luck and Happy
Trading.<p>
