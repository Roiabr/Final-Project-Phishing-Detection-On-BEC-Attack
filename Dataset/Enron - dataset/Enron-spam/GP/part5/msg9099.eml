<br>Faith is not something to grasp, it is a state to grow into.
<br><br>You can set yourself up to be sick, or you can choose to stay =
well.<BR>One should eat to live, not live to eat.
Giving opens the way for receiving.



<BR>Two friends, two bodies with one soul inspired.

Sow much, reap much sow little, reap little.<BR><BR>It is easier to =
discover a deficiency in individuals, in states, and in Providence, than =
to see their real import and value.


The true university of these days is a collection of books.<BR>No cord =
or cable can draw so forcibly, or bind so fast, as love can do with a =
single thread.

<br><br>Adversity is the state in which man mostly easily becomes =
acquainted with himself, being especially free of admirers then.I always =
voted at my party's call, and I never thought of thinking for myself at =
all.


<br><br>The great instrument of moral good is the imagination.

<br><br>Large legislative bodies resolve themselves into coteries, and =
coteries into jealousies.

<BR><BR>You are never given a dream without also being given the power =
to make it true. You may have to work for it, however.



<br>No evil propensity of the human heart is so powerful that it may mot =
be subdued by discipline.I am not the least afraid to die.<br>Art is the =
signature of civilizations.<BR>Don't judge men's wealth or godliness by =
their Sunday appearance.
