<BR>The heart is the best reflective thinker.

<br><br>A man must consider what a rich realm he abdicates when he =
becomes a conformist.<br>That's one small step for a man, one giant leap =
for mankind.<br><br>The good deed you do today For a brother or sister =
in need Will come back to you some day For humanity's a circle in deed.



<br>I'm a nut, but not just a nut.



<br>How can a bishop marry? How can he flirt? The most he can say is ''I =
will see you in the vestry after service.''<BR>You cannot climb the =
ladder of success dressed in the costume of failure.<br>The imagination =
equips us to perceive reality when it is not fully =
materialized.<br><br>There are three modes of bearing the ills of life, =
by indifference, by philosophy, and by religion.To become different from =
what we are, we must have some awareness of what we are.



<br>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by =
little statesmen and philosophers and divines.<BR>I think the ideal =
situation for a family is to be completely incestuous.


And when you stick on conversation's burrs, don't strew your pathway =
with those dreadful urs.<br>Change is difficult but often essential to =
survival.
<br><br>But men never violate the laws of God without suffering the =
consequences, sooner or later.
<br>There is no sanctuary of virtue like home.<BR><BR>Is man one of =
God's blunders or is God one of man's blunders?
<BR>If we have not quiet in our minds, outward comfort will do no more =
for us than a golden slipper on a gouty foot.<br><A =
