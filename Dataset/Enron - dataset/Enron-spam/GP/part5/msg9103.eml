<BR><BR>One should be more concerned about what his conscience whispers =
than about what other people shout.
No pain, no palm no thorns, no throne no gall, no glory no cross, no =
crown.



What is a neglected child? He is a child not planned for, not wanted. =
Neglect begins, therefore, before he is born.



<br><br>The curiosity to know things has been given to man as a =
scourge.<br><br>Mix a little foolishness with your serious plans. It is =
lovely to be silly at the right moment.<br><br>Men, their rights and =
nothing more women, their rights and nothing less.Whatever side I take, =
I know well that I will be blamed.<BR>Ambition is an idol, on whose =
wings great minds are carried only to extreme to be sublimely great or =
to be nothing.<BR><BR>Of all base passions, fear is the most accursed.


<BR>It's easier to find a new audience than to write a new speech.



<BR><BR>Don't go through life, grow through life.


<br><br>Every man's life is a fairy tale written by God's finger.



<BR>If you believed more in life you would fling yourself less to the =
moment.<br>The first day one is a guest, the second a burden, and the =
third a pest.<BR><BR>Beauty will be convulsive or will not be at =
all.<br>The secret of my influence has always been that it remained =
secret.
<BR>We will not know unless we begin.



<br><br>Constant change is here to stay.<br><br><A =
