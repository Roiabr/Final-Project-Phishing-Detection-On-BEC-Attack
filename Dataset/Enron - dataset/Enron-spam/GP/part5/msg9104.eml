Refuse the evil, and choose the good. [Isaiah 7:15]



<br>In the great mass of our people there are plenty individuals of =
intelligence from among whom leadership can be recruited.And now abideth =
faith, hope and charity, these three, but the greatest of these is =
charity. [Corinthians]<br><br>You have been my friends, replied =
Charlotte, that in itself is a tremendous thing...



<BR><BR>One thorn of experience is worth a whole wilderness of warning.



Focus on competition has always been a formula for =
mediocrity.<br><br>Objects in pictures should so be arranged as by their =
very position to tell their own story.

<BR>What are facts but compromises? A fact merely marks the point where =
we have agreed to let investigation cease.
Everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be.



<BR>There is no bad in good.
<BR><BR>Don't worry about your life what you shall eat, or drink, or the =
clothing for your body. [Matthew 6:31]



<BR><BR>God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, =
because it is not there. There is no such thing.Of toiling, uncheered =
and alone, That wins us the prizes worth earning, and leads us to goals =
we would own.



<BR>If you start soon enough, you won't have to run to catch up.<br>It =
is better to be killed than frightened to death.



<br><br>I did not attend his funeral but I wrote a nice letter saying I =
approved of it. [About a politician who had recently died]


<br>There is only one thing harder than looking for a dewdrop in the =
dew, and that is fishing for a clam in the clam chowder.


<br>Pretense is the overrating of any kind of knowledge we pretend =
to.=0D
