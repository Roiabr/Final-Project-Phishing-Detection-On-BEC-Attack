<BR><BR>People are always good company when they are doing what they =
really enjoy.<br>No matter how much the cats fight, there always seem to =
be plenty of kittens.
<BR><BR>Fiction reveals truth that reality obscures.
<br>Fan the sinking flame of hilarity with the wing of friendship and =
pass the rosy wine.



<br>God is a verb.There are many truths of which the full meaning cannot =
be realized until personal experience has brought it home.



<BR><BR>Out of timber so crooked as that from which man is made nothing =
entirely straight can be carved.
<br><br>A man's friendships are one of the best measures of his =
worth.=0D



<br>I went to the root of things, and found nothing but Him alone.
<br>Their sighing , canting , grace-proud faces, their three-mile =
prayers, and half-mile graces.<BR><BR>If you have no problems at your =
job you don't have a job you've got a hobby.

<br><br>Common Sense is very uncommon.<br>Life is not one thing after =
another. It's the same damn thing over and over!

Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken winged bird =
that cannot fly.



<BR><BR>Nothing is sacred to a gamester.
Friendship is to have the latchkey of another's mind.
If something can go wrong it will.


<br>Whatever you believe with feeling becomes your reality.
