<BR>
<BR>
The terror attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001 have<BR>
changed<BR>
the security landscape for the foreseeable future. Both physical and<BR>
logical<BR>
security have become paramount for all industry segments, especially =
in<BR>
the<BR>
banking, national resource and government sectors.&nbsp; According to =
Giga,<BR>
a<BR>
wholly owned subsidiary of Forrester Research, worldwide demand for<BR>
information security products and services is set to eclipse $46B by<BR>
2005.<BR>
<BR>
Homeland Security Investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing<BR>
our<BR>
readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in =
this<BR>
lucrative sector.&nbsp; As we know, events related to homeland =

ourselves in<BR>
such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready =
to<BR>

***Why we believe VNBL.OB will give big returns on investment***<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency<BR>
identification) technology.&nbsp; This is technology which uses tiny =
sensors<BR>
to<BR>
transmit information about a person or object wirelessly.<BR>
<BR>
* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location<BR>
Technology.<BR>
<BR>
* VNBL is developing a form of RFID technology which allows =
companies<BR>
and<BR>
governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources.&nbsp; =
Such<BR>
technology<BR>
has HUGE potential in the protection and transportation of materials<BR>
designated &quot;High Risk&quot; were they to fall into the wrong =
hands.<BR>
<BR>
* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in =
order<BR>
to<BR>
create &quot;High Security Space&quot; in locales where it is deemed =
necessary.&nbsp;<BR>
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea<BR>
ports,<BR>
mines, nuclear facilities, and more.<BR>
<BR>
* As with all stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news =
has<BR>
made&nbsp; VNBL a hot buy.<BR>

NEWS ON VNBL<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2005--Vinoble, Inc.<BR>
(OTCBB:VNBL -<BR>
News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth<BR>
opportunities<BR>
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and<BR>
other<BR>
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products =
and<BR>
services that will assist in the automation of the identification =
and<BR>
control of equipment, assets, tools, and the related processes used =
in<BR>
the<BR>
Oil &amp; Gas and Petrochemical industries.<BR>
<BR>
Although small wirelessly networked RFID sensors can monitor =
machines<BR>
and<BR>
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious, =
they<BR>
can<BR>
also deliver safety features within oil wells. Oil maybe trapped in<BR>
different layers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of<BR>
specific<BR>
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise<BR>
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur,<BR>
such as<BR>
a well filling with water.<BR>
<BR>
As with other RF based technology applications, RFID can also =
provide<BR>
the<BR>
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler, and limit =
the<BR>
entry of personnel to specific locations. Ensuring personnel safety =
is<BR>
essential, should there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags =
would<BR>
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety =
and/or<BR>
danger. This application technology requires product and hardware =
that<BR>
can<BR>
operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions, but gives<BR>
valuable<BR>
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. =
RFID<BR>
can<BR>
also assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oil, gas, and<BR>
chemical<BR>
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail =
level.<BR>
<BR>
Vinoble's viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications =
are<BR>
more<BR>
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry, but as a =
protective<BR>
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against<BR>
threat.<BR>
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety =
of<BR>
U.S.<BR>
industry and economy.<BR>
<BR>
The Company believes that such offering service and technology<BR>
application<BR>
in the Oil &amp; Gas and Petrochemical industry will further =
position<BR>
Vinoble in<BR>
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the<BR>
increasing capital and global spending that the Company will require<BR>
for<BR>
growth. The Company's goal is to also provide a much-needed service =
at<BR>
a<BR>
cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can't afford =
to<BR>
do<BR>
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state =
of<BR>
constant threat.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is Outstanding news.&nbsp; The growth potential for this company =
is<BR>
exceptional.&nbsp; In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a =
truly<BR>
innovative pioneer.&nbsp; We see big things happening to this stock.<BR>
