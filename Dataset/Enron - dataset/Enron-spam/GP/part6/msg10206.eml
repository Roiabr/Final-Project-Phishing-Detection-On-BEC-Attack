<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Friend,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investment Assistance<BR>
I humbly approach you with a view that we may be able to enter into a =
mutual<BR>
business transaction that could be of immense benefit to both parties. =
As<BR>
led by my instinct, I decided to contact you through email, after =
searching<BR>
for Contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact =
anybody<BR>
since I am cutting off ties with Sierra Leone for now. I apologize if =
this<BR>
is not acceptable to you. Foremost; I should begin by introducing =
myself.<BR>
I am&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. PATRICK TAMA the son of late Mr.&nbsp; GEORGE TAMA, =
a precious stone<BR>
merchant in Sierra Leone, who died on the 6th of May 2001.<BR>
After the death of my father, the Government of Sierra Leone arrested =
my<BR>
mum and my kid brother on the allegation that my father was a front man =
to<BR>
the late dictators of Sierra Leone. All my father's assets were =
confiscated,<BR>
by the present government and during this injustice; my brother and my =
mum<BR>
were maltreated and tortured. From this trauma, my mum fell sick and =
died.<BR>
After the whole incident, I went through my Afather's document and I =
found<BR>
out that he lodged $12 800,000.00 (Twelve Million Eight Hundred =
Thousand<BR>
Dollars)&nbsp;&nbsp; kept in custody for us in a security company =
stashed in trunk<BR>
boxes and deposited as personal belongings before he died, out side =
my<BR>
country and he intended investing it before his untimely death.<BR>
Sir, my intention now is to invest in your country, in any =
profitable<BR>
business you deem fit. I will be grateful if we could come into =
joint<BR>
business partnership. Because of my family background I shy away =
publicity.<BR>
Precisely, I prefer staying away from well know public figures in =
any<BR>
country. Hence I won't want my name mentioned to any one, as I still =
want to<BR>
stay away from the scrutiny of my country government. Mentioning this =
mail<BR>
to anyone may put me in a big mess and cause me to lose the money. As =
soon<BR>
as I receive your consent I will immediately forward the contact and =
all<BR>
other information of where and how to collect this money.<BR>
For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can<BR>
Choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open =
an<BR>
account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into =
partnership<BR>
with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your =
country.<BR>
Looking forward to hearing from you soon you can also reach me on =
telephone<BR>
number&nbsp; 0031 617664901 for further discussion on this project.<BR>
Thanks<BR>
Mr. PATRICK TAMA&nbsp; </FONT>
