My Lordship,<BR>

Calvary greetings in the name of God, I am former Mrs. Fatima Abass =

Yakubu<BR>
Idris.<BR>
<BR>
I am 65years old; I am now a new Christian convert, suffering from =
long<BR>
time cancer of the breast. From all indications, my condition is =
really<BR>
deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six<BR>
months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very Severe stage. =
My<BR>
late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of =
our<BR>
marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the =
Gulf<BR>
war.<BR>
<BR>
My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all =
his<BR>
business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live =
for<BR>
more than six months and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided =
to<BR>
divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well beign of =
less<BR>
privileged people and handicapped in the society of Africa, which is in =
my<BR>
place, America Europe and Asian Countries.<BR>
<BR>
This mission, which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently<BR>
relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this<BR>
Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of<BR>
$3,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the =
well<BR>
beign of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less<BR>
privileged around your country, and i have map out $700,000.00 for =
your<BR>
own personal use to help me for this work .<BR>
<BR>
Please note that, this fund is lying in a Bank in Europe and, therefore =
my<BR>
lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money =
in<BR>
your name or your home. Please, do not reply me if you have the =
intention<BR>
of using this fund for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort =
of<BR>
the Handicapped.<BR>
<BR>
Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my =
entire<BR>
life and my health because I have come to find out since my =
spiritual<BR>
birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity =
upon<BR>
vanity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I await your urgent reply.<BR>
<BR>
YOURS IN GOD'S LOVE,<BR>
