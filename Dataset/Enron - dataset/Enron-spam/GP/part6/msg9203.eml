This was the first time she had seen any of the children actually =
playing, or even moving around. After about an hour Betty gathered all =
the balls and headed back to the tent. The next day, the children asked =
about the balls. Betty told them that after they had eaten all their =
food, they could play. Eating all the food allotted was important for =
each undernourished child. But, many of them would not eat their food =
because it was so different from the food they were used to, and these =
children were not getting stronger. However, because they were now able =
to play with the balls and with the other children, their food was soon =
finished, and more and more children became strong enough to come to =
play.<BR>
