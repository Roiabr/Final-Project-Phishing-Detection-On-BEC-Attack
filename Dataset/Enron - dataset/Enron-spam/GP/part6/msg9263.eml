<p><font color=3D"#C0C0C0">Hospitals treated 43 people for minor =
injuries after the crash, said Steve Shaw, chairman of the Greater =
Toronto Airports Authority. "As the plane stopped, they jumped off and =
made their way across to the highway," Hantash said. "I'm going to give =
him a good hug and good kiss and take him home."Hale said NASA managers =
are satisfied that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent =
Robinson from damaging the tiles during the repair operation, which =
could make Discovery's re-entry even more problematic.During the =
procedure, Robinson will only be visible to the other members of =
Discovery's crew via a camera on the space shuttle's boom. A second =
astronaut, Soichi Noguchi, will be spacewalking at the same time, but he =
will be working on other tasks.</font></p>
