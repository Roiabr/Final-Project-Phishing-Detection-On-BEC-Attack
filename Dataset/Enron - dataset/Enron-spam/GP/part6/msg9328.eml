Hi,<BR>
<BR>
I sent you an email a while ago, because you qualified for a<BR>
much lower rate based on our records from a national database.<BR>
Why is this? Because currently it is a buyers market with the<BR>
lowest rates in years.<BR>
<BR>
You can now get $325,000 for as little as $709 a month!<BR>
We realize many homeowners struggle and that makes it difficult<BR>
to maintain good credit. But we specialize in poor credit cases- helping =
you<BR>
to refinance even with bad credit, helping you lower your monthly<BR>
burden and build back your credit.<BR>
You will receive the lowest rate possible in your special =
circumstance<BR>
<BR>
You can fill out this quick form and be approved within 24 hours:<BR>
