add-on<BR>
sales that bring $5,000 and $8,000, with no additional work. All that =

be<BR>
shown every step of the way. People from all walks of life are =

exceptional results. Ordinary people become extraordinary in a matter =
of<BR>
weeks!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Unlike &quot;traditional&quot; businesses such as franchises costing =
$50,000 to<BR>
$500,000 with unstable income and requiring work levels of 60-80 hours =
a<BR>
week, this business has the potential of generating results =
quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; You<BR>

share<BR>
their expertise so that YOU can be successful. You will not be relying =
on<BR>
just one individual - our entire team is dedicated to your success.<BR>

Frequently Asked Questions<BR>
Q: Is this M L M (Multi-Level Marketing)?<BR>
A: No it is not. M L M is a great concept but it lacks a system that<BR>
provides individual support. Also, realistically it takes 1-5 years =
to<BR>
achieve huge success in an M L M. Our system is designed for you to =
achieve<BR>
success in a shorter period - almost from the first week of working =
your<BR>
business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

do we<BR>
try to convince anyone to buy our products.<BR>
<BR>
Q: Are there other costs involved in running this business?<BR>
A: No. Anyone who tells you that it does take money to build a business =
is<BR>
lying to you. This is a business that generates a substantial income =
and<BR>
does not require initial investments.<BR>

this<BR>
business?<BR>

all<BR>
the businesses, I would say for most everyone, it will be a 1 if they =
are<BR>

The System for Your Success<BR>
<BR>
Your Action=3DYour Success!<BR>
<BR>
Winners Take Action!<BR>
WINNERS make decisions and take action. . .<BR>
when they see an opportunity. They also follow the examples of other<BR>
successful people because it's much more efficient than learning the =
hard<BR>
way. Winners don't make excuses and they never procrastinate. Losers =
will<BR>
procrastinate or study a problem endlessly to make sure they don't =
do<BR>
anything &quot;rash&quot;. You can either decide to leave my ad without =
responding or<BR>
you can call now and get started immediately in one of the most =
exciting<BR>
businesses available today.<BR>
<BR>

background, are running successful businesses from home setting their =
own<BR>
hours and making fortunes by following a simple marketing system that =

<BR>
Lame Excuse #3<BR>
&quot;I've tried other businesses that sound similar to this, so I don't =
think I<BR>
am going to call.&quot;<BR>
Colonel Sanders tried to sell the idea of Kentucky Fried Chicken 1700 =
times<BR>
before someone bought into the idea. What if he had thought the same as =
you<BR>
and given up after the 10th time, or worse, given up on the 1699th =
try.<BR>
Persistence and belief in yourself is the key to success.<BR>
<BR>

the<BR>
next time. Walking away from this opportunity is giving up, plain =
and<BR>
simple. Successful people NEVER quit or give up on themselves!!<BR>
