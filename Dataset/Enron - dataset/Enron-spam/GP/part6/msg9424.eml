<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear friend,<BR>
<BR>
I have a proposal for you, this however is not mandatory nor will I in =
any<BR>
manner compel you to honour against your will.<BR>
<BR>
I am Mr Maxwell Ibeanusi, an auditor with a bank (one of the African =
leading banks<BR>
in the West Coast). Here in this bank existed a dormant account for the =
past<BR>
8 years which belong to a American national who is now late Mr Morris =
Thompson<BR>
who died on Alaska Airlines Flight 261. <A =
HREF=3D"http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/">http=
://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/</A><BR>
More details about the deceased himself,you can check on<BR>
(<A =
HREF=3D"http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html">ht=
tp://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html</A>)<BR>
<BR>
When I discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals from =
this<BR>
account for this long period, I decided to carry out a system =
investigation<BR>
and discovered that non of the family member nor relations of the late =
person<BR>
<BR>
is aware of this account. This is the story in a nutshell.<BR>
<BR>
Now I want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this =
funds.Thereafter,<BR>
I had planned to destroy all related documents for this account. It is =
a<BR>
careful network and for the past eleven months I have worked out =
everything<BR>
to ensure a hitch-free operation. The amount is not so much at the =
moment<BR>
and plus all the accumulated interest the balance in this account =
stands<BR>
at-(US$15.4million US dollars).<BR>
<BR>
Now my questions are:-<BR>
1. Can you handle this project?<BR>
2. Can I give you this trust?<BR>
3. What will be your commission&nbsp; if you can assist us with&nbsp; =
this transfer?<BR>
<BR>
Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as contained =
herein<BR>
be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it =
deserves.<BR>
<BR>
I Expect your urgent response if you can handle this project. I am<BR>
expecting your urgent response as soon as you receive my message.<BR>
<BR>
Respectfully yours,<BR>
<BR>
Mr Maxwell Ibeanusi.&nbsp; </FONT>
