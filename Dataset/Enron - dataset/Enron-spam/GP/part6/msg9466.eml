<P><FONT SIZE=2>ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO<BR>
Dear Sir,<BR>
I am Chief Dr. Perry T. Nelson, a native of Cape Town in South<BR>
Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the<BR>
South African department of Mining and Natural Resources.<BR>
Please accept my apology for using this medium to<BR>
convey a transaction/business of this magnitude, but<BR>
this is due to the confidentiality and prompt access<BR>
reposed on this medium. I have decided to<BR>
seek your co-operation in the execution of this deal<BR>
described hereunder, for the benefit of all parties<BR>
and hoping you will keep it as TOP SECRET because<BR>
of the nature of the business.<BR>
Within the department of Mining and Natural<BR>
Resources (where I work as a director), and with the<BR>
cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our<BR>
possession as overdue payment bills totaling Forty Five Million,<BR>
Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$45,500,000.00)<BR>
which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance<BR>
and cooperation of a company/or an individual to<BR>
receive the said funds, via a reliable Bank Account.<BR>
Quite frankly, we are handicapped as the South<BR>
African civil service laws (Code of Conduct Bureau) strongly<BR>
prohibits us from owning/or operating a foreign<BR>
account hence your importance in this<BR>
whole transaction.<BR>
This amount (US$45.5M) represents the balance of the<BR>
total value of a contract executed on behalf of my<BR>
department by a foreign contracting firm which we<BR>
the officials (involved) deliberately over-invoiced.<BR>
Though the actual cost have been paid to the<BR>
original contractor leaving the balance in the tune of the<BR>
said amount which we have in principle gotten approval to<BR>
remit by Key Tested Telegraphic transfer (K.T.T.) to<BR>
any foreign bank account you will provide by filing<BR>
an application through the justice ministry here in<BR>
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges<BR>
of the former contractor to you.<BR>
I have the authority of my partners involved to<BR>
propose that should you be willing to assist us in<BR>
this transaction by way of providing the required<BR>
account in receiving these funds, your share of the<BR>
entire sum will be 30% amounting to Us$13.65Million<BR>
of the US$45.5Million, 60% amounting to US$27.3Million<BR>
for us and 10% amounting to US$4.55Million will be<BR>
used to settle taxation and other miscellaneous<BR>
expenses in the course of transferring the funds to your account.<BR>
The business itself is 100% foolproof<BR>
and safe, as long as you maintain utmost secrecy and<BR>
confidentiality. Further more your area of<BR>
specialization will not be a hindrance to the<BR>
successful completion of this transaction. I have<BR>
reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not<BR>
disappoint me. Should you be willing to assist<BR>
positively with a common goal, endeavor to contact<BR>
me immediately through my above email address.<BR>
If you are not interested, please also indicate so<BR>
that it will enable me to contact other foreign<BR>
partner with recommendations to carry out this deal.<BR>
I want to assure you that my colleagues and I are in<BR>
position to make the payment of this claim possible<BR>
provided that you can give us a very concrete<BR>
assurance of the safety of our share. Please, always<BR>
treat this matter with utmost confidentiality,<BR>
because we will not comprehend any form of exposure as we<BR>
are still in active government service. Time is of<BR>
essence in this business, so kindly act fast.<BR>
I await in anticipation your fullest co-operation.<BR>
Yours Faithfully,<BR>
Chief Dr. Perry T. Nelson.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>
