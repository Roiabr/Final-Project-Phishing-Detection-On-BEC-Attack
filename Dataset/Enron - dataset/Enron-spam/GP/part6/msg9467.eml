<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Sir,<BR>
<BR>
My name is Basheer Mohammed Said Bsharat(Jnr)&nbsp; and i am a 24yrs =
old<BR>
Jordain on exile in Dubai, UAE. I write you because i need urgent =
help.<BR>
My father is Late Basheer Mohammed Said Bsharat who before his death<BR>
was a major oil merchant in my country Jordan.<BR>
<BR>
I believe my father was murdered by his jealous brothers who at the<BR>
moment are after my life too. I own a trust fund which my father<BR>
opened for me in one of the big Arab banks in Jordan but i cannot<BR>
access thisfund because i am not old enough yet.<BR>
<BR>
I need an older person to pose as my guardian so that i can collect<BR>
this fund before my uncles see me and make me sign documents that i<BR>
do not want to sign.<BR>
<BR>
I will disclose the Bank, account details and amount to anyone who =
can<BR>
help me secure the release of this fund. IT IS ALL THAT I HAVE LEFT.<BR>
<BR>
I will send my positive identification i.e my international<BR>
Passport copy and Drivers license to prove that i am who i say i am.<BR>
<BR>
I await your positive response.<BR>
<BR>
Basheer<BR>
