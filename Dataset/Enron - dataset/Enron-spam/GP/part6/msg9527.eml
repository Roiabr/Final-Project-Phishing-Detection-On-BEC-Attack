<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello,<BR>
<BR>
My boyfriend began having problems with erections (he's older)<BR>
and I suggested he look into VlAGRRA Softtabs.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boy, am I glad he did!<BR>
<BR>
The first time he tried it, one 50 mg piIl did nothing so he took =
another and that was a mistake. Three hours later he was still rock hard =
and had come multiple times (so had I)!! Since then a single 50 mg dose =
does iThe first of these was that he should have been brought to trial =
att very well--he's now good for almost 2 hours of good hard sex that =
leaves both of us worn out.<BR>
