<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Hello,<BR>
<BR>
Did you ejaculate before or within a few minutes of<BR>
penetration?<BR>
<BR>
Premature ejaculation occurs when you ejaculate too quickly<BR>
and without control. It occurs before or shortly after<BR>
penetration. Premature ejaculation interferes with the sexual<BR>
pleasure of both you and your partner. It causes feelings of<BR>
guilt, embarrassment, frustration, and depression.<BR>
<BR>
Extra-Time is the only male sexual performance formula that,<BR>
not only stops premature ejaculation, but actually &quot;cures&quot; =
it.<BR>
Extra-Time is the only product that allows &quot;YOU&quot; to =
control<BR>
when you ejaculate.<BR>
