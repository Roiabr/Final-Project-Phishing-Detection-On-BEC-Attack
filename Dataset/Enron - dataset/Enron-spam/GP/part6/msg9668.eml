<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Attention:Your Concern<BR>
<BR>
My Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
I am Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian Head of =
state,<BR>
General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on<BR>
active service for our Country. I am contacting you with the hope =
that<BR>
you will be of great assistance to me, I currently have within my =
reach<BR>
the sum of 24 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for<BR>
investment purposes outside Nigeria.<BR>
<BR>
This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my<BR>
husband and a Russian firm inour country's multi-billion dollar<BR>
Ajaokuta steel plant. The Russian partners returned my husbands =
share<BR>
being the above sum after his death. Presently, the new civilian<BR>
Government has intensified&nbsp; their probe into my husbands =
financial<BR>
resources which has led to the freezing of all our accounts, local =
and<BR>
foreign, the revoking of all our business licences and the arrest of =
my<BR>
First son. In view of this I acted very fast to withdraw this money<BR>
from one of our finance houses before it was closed down. I have<BR>
deposited the money in a security company with the help of very =
loyal<BR>
officials of my late husband. No record is known about this fund by =
the<BR>
government because there is no documentation showing that we =
received<BR>
such funds.<BR>
<BR>
Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude =
to<BR>
my family, I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your<BR>
help in transferring this funds out of the sub-African region. =
Bearing<BR>
in mind that you may assist me, l have decided to part with 20% of =
the<BR>
total sum.<BR>
<BR>
Please kindly reply to my email inclcude your personal telephone and<BR>
fax numbers.<BR>
<BR>
Your urgent response is needed.<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha<BR>
