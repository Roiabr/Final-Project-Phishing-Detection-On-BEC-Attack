Lebanon's anti-Syrian opposition, which has demanded for months that =
pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud resign, called for demonstrators to =
gather near the presidential palace on Monday. In one incident, on =
February 23, 2004, the report said a guard saw a &quot;detainee place =
two Qurans in his toilet and state he no longer cared about the Quran or =
his religion. The state-run Korean Central News Agency this week called =
Vice President Dick Cheney a &quot;bloodthirsty beast&quot; for saying =
that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was irresponsible. The militants, =
known as the Fatah Hawks, are affiliated with Abbas' ruling party. In a =
fifth confirmed incident, it could not be determined whether a guard or =
a detainee wrote a two-word obscenity in a Quran.<BR>
