<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Mr.Joshua Nkosi,<BR>
ABSA Bank Limited,<BR>
Johannesburg, South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
Dear Sir,<BR>
I am Mr.Joshua Nkosi, manager of bills/exchange at the<BR>
foreign remittance department of ABSA Bank. In my department, we<BR>
discovered an abandoned sum of US$14,700,000.00(Fourteen Million, Seven =
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that belonged =
to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family, =
on November<BR>
1996, in a ghastly plane crash,and he happened to be a Foreigner. Since =
we got the information about his death, we have been expecting his =
next-of-kin to come over and claim his money<BR>
because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of =
kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our<BR>
banking guidelines. Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this =
money.<BR>
It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have =
decided to establish a cordial business relationship<BR>
with you, hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as =
the next of kin through your relation with the deceased, so that the =
funds can be remitted into your account.<BR>
Moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government account as =
unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here<BR>
stipulates that any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of =
years, is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the =
government treasury account.<BR>
Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be<BR>
transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or =
before the end of this financial quarterof 2005, when nobody come =
forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting you to<BR>
present yourself as next of kin, is occasioned by, the fact that the =
deceased (customer) was a foreigner, and we have<BR>
access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to =
present yourself as the next of kin.<BR>
The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your =
account, shall be 70% to my colleagues and I, for the<BR>
role you will be expected to play in this deal, we have agreed to give =
you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to =
encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. =
Therefore, you are expected to reply this letter indicating your =
readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving =
your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact steps to =
take.<BR>
I expect your urgent response through my email address =
:joshuakosi@maktoob.com.And I shall contact you for further discussion =
on this matter,to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without =
any delay or hitch.<BR>
Please treat this business proposal as strictly<BR>
confidential for security reasons considering my official position in =
ABSA Bank.<BR>
Personal Regards,<BR>
Mr.Joshua Nkosi.<BR>
