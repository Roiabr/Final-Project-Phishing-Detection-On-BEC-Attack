<P><FONT SIZE=2>Hallo Dear<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Greetings from Hong Kong<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I am very sorry trying to bother you in this my time of<BR>
&nbsp;need. However, I am Mrs. Yakaru Hucheng, the second<BR>
&nbsp;wife to Mr chino hucheng, who was the owner of<BR>
&nbsp;LIGHTGREEN MARINE CORP. Hong Kong I was married to him&nbsp;<BR>
unfortunately I did not born any child for him throughout<BR>
our<BR>
stay as husband and wife.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;My husband died last month after suffering from long time<BR>
&nbsp;heart cancer, which suffered him for many years and finally<BR>
&nbsp;died last month . He called me and his first wife with his<BR>
&nbsp;personal attorney and share some of his wealth to both of<BR>
us<BR>
&nbsp;as the inheritors of his wealth because his personal doctor<BR>
has<BR>
&nbsp;told him in advance that hewill not live for the next 5<BR>
days.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Immediately the dead of my late husband, the first wife and<BR>
&nbsp;the attorney joined together and changed almost all the<BR>
&nbsp;documents that I inherited from my husband as my own share<BR>
&nbsp;of his wealth to the name of her two sons. Now the one that<BR>
&nbsp;makes me to seek assistance and run away from their site is<BR>
the<BR>
&nbsp;deposit certificate, which was issued to my late husband on<BR>
the day<BR>
&nbsp;he deposited the sum of 13 million dollars in a security<BR>
&nbsp;company in Europe which he gave to me in the presence of<BR>
&nbsp;the first wife and his personal attorney, they are now<BR>
&nbsp;trying to take away from me the deposit certificate which<BR>
&nbsp;is the only document among the documents that was given to<BR>
&nbsp;me as my share of his wealth.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Now, I need your help. I want to present your name to the<BR>
&nbsp;security company as the beneficiary of this deposited money<BR>
&nbsp;so that the security company will release the money to you<BR>
&nbsp;and then you will deposit the money in your personal<BR>
&nbsp;account there in your country. If you can help me to secure<BR>
&nbsp;this money in your custody without any problem, then I will<BR>
&nbsp;give you 30 % of the 13 million dollars while you will keep<BR>
70<BR>
&nbsp;% for me. I have the deposit certificate, which is the only<BR>
&nbsp;thing you need for the claiming of the money.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;My life is in danger here in Hong Kong; I am hiding because<BR>
they<BR>
&nbsp;are seriously searching for me just to take away the<BR>
deposit<BR>
&nbsp;certificate from me. The have alreadytaken away my<BR>
international<BR>
&nbsp;passport and traveling papers,just to stop me from<BR>
traveling to Europe<BR>
&nbsp;for the claiming of the money.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;After hearing from you, I will give you the contact of the<BR>
&nbsp;diplomat who is in charge of the money and also give the<BR>
&nbsp;diplomat your contact so that you can contact each other<BR>
&nbsp;immediately.<BR>
