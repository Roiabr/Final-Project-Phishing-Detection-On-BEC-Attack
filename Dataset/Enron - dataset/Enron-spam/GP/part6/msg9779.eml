patience while you read through my message.I have a very urgent and =
confidential business proposition for you.On June 6th 1999, an =
Engineer/Consultant/Contractor with a big and Influential Multi national =
Oil Company and a foreigner here made a time deposit in a bank Which I =
am presently the Manager.He did not declare any next of kin in his =
application paper. The money is very big and no one knows the source of =
this money because apparently the time frame of his employment with the =
company here in Africa does indeed preclude such a large amount of =
money.It can be<BR>
assumed that he brought his money over from his country or previous =
place of work but that is open to speculation.However,the point is that =
he is dead and his employers are not aware Of this money,and therefore =
it can be safely assumed that no one will ever come forward to claim =
this money, he died in 2002. The total sum (inclusive of accrued =
interests) is still sitting in my Bank in the&nbsp; Dormant Account =
Portfolio. No one will ever come forward to claim it&nbsp; now or in the =
future and according to our banking laws, after 5 years,the money will =
automatically revert to the Federal Government Treasury if the Account =
owner is a foreigner and is certified dead but with you a foreigner =
applying for the transfer of this fund to your nominated account =
anywhere in the world and all documents backing the transfer legally =
secured and there is certification that the funds being transferred are =
from non-criminal sources we will have no problems.In short this will be =
a proper and legal money<BR>
transfer and there will be no related<BR>
risk!<BR>
We will have to process the initial paperwork to obtain approval from =
the Probate Registry (Ministry of Justice) and obtain the Letter of =
Administration empowering you as Sole trustee/executor to the deceased =
Estate after which I will use my position and influence in the bank to =
effect onward transfer of this money from our bank to your nominated =
account. If you therefore agree to be the official Beneficiary, then =
please note that you will be required to avail me with a bank account (a =
bank account with zero Credit Balance is ok).Your full address,<BR>
phone and fax,full name and brief background information on you =
(CV).<BR>
As soon as I receive a positive response on your willingness to assist =
me then I will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about 7 =
working days the money will be in your nominated bank account for us To =
share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you.<BR>
This transaction is guaranteed to success without any problems. If you =
agree to assist me by sending me the above requested Information, I will =
give you my complete address, including phone/ fax etc and any further =
clarifications you may require.Looking forward to your urgent reply.<BR>
