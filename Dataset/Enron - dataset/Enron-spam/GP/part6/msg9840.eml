Dear Sir,<BR>
First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction; this is by =
virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. =
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone =
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at =
the end of the day. We have decided to contact you by e-mail due to the =
urgency of this transaction. Let me start by first introducing myself =
properly to you. I am DR.DAN NKANGA, a Manager in advances department of =
the ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK LTD, Lagos. I came to know of you in my =
private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very =
confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of =
money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence. I am not too =
really sure if you are my long lost contact whom I am trying to reach, =
but in anyway, please do take this message with a good heart and report =
back to me if you are not the person I think you are. I would explain =
more !<BR>
latter.<BR>
THE PROPOSITION:<BR>
A foreigner, late Engineer SANN CLARKE, an Oil Merchant / contractor =
with the federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago =
in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at ZENITH BANK Lagos, and =
had a closing balance of USD$27.5M ( Twenty Seven Million and Five =
hundred thousand, United States Dollars) which the bank now =
unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign =
next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for =
the purchase of arms and ammunition at a military war college here in =
Nigeria. A fervent valuable effort has been made by our bank (ZENITH =
INTERNATIONAL BANK) to get in touch with any of the CLARKE family or =
relatives but all have proved to no avail. It is because of the =
perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any of late =
Engr. SANN Clarke&amp;#8217;s next of kin, wife or children that our =
Chairman and board of directors have decided to declare the funds =
(UNCLAIMED) and then be subsequently do!<BR>
nated to the discredited Trust Fund for the purchase of Arms and =
Ammunitions for war in Africa against other continent in the world. In =
order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my trusted =
collaborating colleagues here at the bank now seek for your permission =
to have you stand as late Engr. SANN Clarke&amp;#8217;s next of kin so =
that the funds could be subsequently transferred into your bank account =
as the beneficiary&amp;#8217;s next of kin. All documents and proves to =
authenticate you as the rightful next of kin to the beneficiary will be =
carefully arranged such that the deal will be a 100% risk free =
involvement. For your assistance and collaboration , your commission =
will be 20%, 75% shall be for myself and my collaborating colleagues for =
investment purposes in your country while 5% will be set aside for any =
expenses that would be incurred in the process of the transfer.<BR>
If this proposal is OK, and you do not wish to take advantage of the =
trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get to me =
immediately via my most exclusive e-mail: dr.dan@postino.it&nbsp; =
furnishing me with your most confidential telephone, fax number and =
exclusive e-mail so that I can forward to you the relevant details of =
this transaction.<BR>
Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation<BR>
<BR>
Best regards and God blessings,<BR>
