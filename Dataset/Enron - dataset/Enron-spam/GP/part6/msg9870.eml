<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry =
for<BR>
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My<BR>
name is<BR>
Asraf ahmed........., a merchant in U.K.I have been diagnosed<BR>
with Esophageal cancer .<BR>
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and<BR>
right now I have only about a few months to live,<BR>
according to medical<BR>
experts. I have not particularly lived my life so<BR>
well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even<BR>
myself)but my business.<BR>
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was<BR>
always hostile to people and only focused on my<BR>
business as that was the<BR>
only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I<BR>
now know that there is more to life than just wanting<BR>
to have or make<BR>
all the money in the world. I believe when God gives<BR>
me a second chance to come to this world,I would live<BR>
my life a<BR>
different way from how I have lived it.<BR>
<BR>
Now that God has called me, I have willed and given<BR>
most of my property and assets to my immediate and<BR>
extended family<BR>
members as well as a few close friends. I want God to<BR>
be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided<BR>
to give also to<BR>
charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the<BR>
last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have<BR>
distributed money to<BR>
some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and<BR>
Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so<BR>
badly, I cannot do this<BR>
myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to<BR>
close one of my accounts and distribute the money<BR>
which I have there to<BR>
charity organizations in Asia and U.K, they refused<BR>
and kept the money to themselves.<BR>
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not<BR>
to be contended with what I have left for them. The<BR>
last of my money<BR>
which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of<BR>
twenty five million dollars $25,000,000.00 that I have with<BR>
a finance institution<BR>
in Europe. I will want you to help me collect this<BR>
deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations.<BR>
I have set aside 20% for you and some expences that<BR>
may incure during the proccess of these transaction.<BR>
God be with you.Please reach me through my personal<BR>
email address of: asraf_ahmed708@hotmail.com<BR>
remember to keep this known to<BR>
yourself alone and I for now,as I am doing this as a<BR>
contribution to life on earth.I will also appreciate<BR>
if you<BR>
provide me with your contact mobile and home phone<BR>
numbers,so that i can forward them to my trustee who would put you =
through the whole process.I<BR>
will really appreciate your quick response.<BR>
Stay Blessed,<BR>
