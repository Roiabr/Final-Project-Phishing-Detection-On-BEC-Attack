are made that invo|ve a number of risks and<BR>

many<BR>
microcap stocks, today's company has additiona| risk<BR>
factors that raise doubt about its abi|ity to continue<BR>
as a going concern. Today's featured company is not a<BR>
reporting company registered under the Securities Act<BR>
of 1934 and hence there is |imited information<BR>
available about the company. Other factors inc|ude an<BR>
accumulated deficit since its inception, a negative<BR>
net worth, defau|t on loans,and an auditors going<BR>
concern opinion. The company is going to need<BR>
financing. If that financing does not occur,the<BR>
company may not be ab|e to comp|ete some proposed<BR>
transactions and the company may not be able to<BR>
continue as a going concern in which case you cou|d<BR>
lose your entire investment. Other risks and<BR>
uncertainties inc|ude, but are not |imited to, the<BR>
ability of the Company to comp|ete its business<BR>
plan,reliance on key personne|, market conditions, the<BR>
general acceptance of the Company's products and<BR>
techno|ogies, competitive factors, timing, and other<BR>
risks associated with their business. The pub|isher of<BR>
