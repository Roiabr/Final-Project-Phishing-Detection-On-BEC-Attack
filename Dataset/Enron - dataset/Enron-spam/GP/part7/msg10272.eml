Spur-M.<BR>
I suffered from poor sperm count and motility. I found<BR>
your site and ordered Spur-M Fertility Blend for Men.<BR>
I have wondered for years what caused low semen and sperm<BR>
count, and how I could improve my fertility and help my wife<BR>
conceive. Spur-M seems to have done just that! Thank you<BR>
for your support.&quot;<BR>

&quot;Spur-M really does help improve fertility and effectiveness<BR>
of sperm and semen motility. I used it for the past few months,<BR>
and not only does it work - I also feel better to. I have<BR>
more energy. This is an excellent counter to low sperm count<BR>
and motility. I'll be buying more!!!&quot;<BR>

&quot;I had been wondering on the causes of low semen and<BR>
sperm count, I was searching for this type of information<BR>
when I found your site. I hadn't been made aware of this<BR>
product before then, so was quite surprised to be able<BR>
to find a Male fertility product. Usually everything is<BR>
geared towards female fertility. Suffice to say I ordered<BR>
and a few months later we received the good news from the<BR>
Doctors - My wife is pregnant. I can't be 100% sure if<BR>
it was Spur-M that helped. But I am happy enough to be able<BR>
to say it should be considered by any man looking to increase<BR>
his fertility. It worked for me. Thanks.&quot;<BR>
