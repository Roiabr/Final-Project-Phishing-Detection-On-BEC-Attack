<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Did you know that you could cut your food right down =
to 1000 calories and still gain weight?<BR>
Eat 1000, burn only 800 and you will gain weight- even though you're =
constantly hungry.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, you could eat say 3,000 calories and loose a lot of =
weight- If you burn 3,500<BR>
which has less to do with exercise and mostly has to do with your =
metabolism.<BR>
Boost your metabolism effectively&nbsp; and loose those unwanted =
pounds.<BR>
Do some moderate exercise while taking it and loose even more pounds =
naturally and rapidly.<BR>
Everyone that has ever lost a lot of weight knows that this is the only =
prooven way to loose and<BR>
keep the pounds off.<BR>
Just dieting or exersing is simply not enough if you have a slow =
matabolism due to your genes.<BR>
