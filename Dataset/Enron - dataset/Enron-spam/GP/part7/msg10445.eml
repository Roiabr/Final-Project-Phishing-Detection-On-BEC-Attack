<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>At the sunset&nbsp; hour of one warm spring day =
two&nbsp; men were&nbsp; to be seen at<BR>
Patriarch's Ponds. The first of them--aged about forty, dressed in a =
greyish<BR>
summer&nbsp; suit--was&nbsp; short,&nbsp; dark-haired,&nbsp; =
well-fed&nbsp; and bald.&nbsp; He carried his<BR>
decorous pork-pie hat by the brim and his neatly shaven face was =
embellished<BR>
by&nbsp; black hornrimmed spectacles of&nbsp; preternatural&nbsp; =
dimensions. The other,&nbsp; a<BR>
broad-shouldered young&nbsp; man with&nbsp; curly reddish hair&nbsp; and =
a check cap pushed<BR>
back&nbsp; to the nape of&nbsp; his neck,&nbsp; was&nbsp; wearing a =
tartan&nbsp; shirt,&nbsp; chewed white<BR>
trousers and black sneakers.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first was none other than Mikhail =
Alexandrovich&nbsp; Berlioz, editor of<BR>
a&nbsp; highbrow literary magazine&nbsp; and chairman of the management =
cofnmittee&nbsp; of<BR>
one of the&nbsp; biggest Moscow&nbsp; literary&nbsp; clubs, known =
by&nbsp; its&nbsp; abbreviation&nbsp; as<BR>

Ivan&nbsp; Nikolayich Poniryov who<BR>
wrote under the pseudonym of Bezdomny.<BR>
