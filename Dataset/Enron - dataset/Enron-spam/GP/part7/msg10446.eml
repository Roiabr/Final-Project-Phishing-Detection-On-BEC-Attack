So they felt it would be useless to search any farther. But the queen =
was a very clever woman; she could do a great deal more than merely ride =
in a carriage. She took her large gold scissors, cut a piece of silk =
into squares, and made a neat little bag. This bag she filled with =
buckwheat flour, and tied it round the princess's neck; and then she cut =
a small hole in the bag, so that the flour might be scattered on the =
ground as the princess went along. During the night, the dog came again =
and carried the princess on his back, and ran with her to the soldier, =
who loved her very much, and wished that he had been a prince, so that =
he might have her for a wife. The dog did not observe how the flour ran =
out of the bag all the way from the castle wall to the soldier's house, =
and even up to the window, where he had climbed with the princess. =
Therefore in the morning the king and queen found out where their =
daughter had been, and the soldier was taken up and put in prison. Oh, =
how dark and disagreeable it was as he sat there, and the people said to =
him, "To-morrow you will be hanged." It was not very pleasant news, and =
besides, he had left the tinder-box at the inn. In the morning he could =
see through the iron grating of the little window how the people were =
hastening out of the town to see him hanged; he heard the drums beating, =
and saw the soldiers marching. Every one ran out to look at them. and a =
shoemaker's boy, with a leather apron and slippers on, galloped by so =
fast, that one of his slippers flew off and struck against the wall =
where the soldier sat looking through the iron grating. "Hallo, you =
shoemaker's boy, you need not be in such a hurry," cried the soldier to =
him. "There will be nothing to see till I come; but if you will run to =
the house where I have been living, and bring me my tinder-box, you =
shall have four shillings, but you must put your best foot foremost."
The shoemaker's boy liked the idea of getting the four shillings, so he =
ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and gave it to the soldier. =
And now we shall see what happened. Outside the town a large gibbet had =
been erected, round which stood the soldiers and several thousands of =
people. The king and the queen sat on splendid thrones opposite to the =
judges and the whole council. The soldier already stood on the ladder; =
but as they were about to place the rope around his neck, he said that =
an innocent request was often granted to a poor criminal before he =
suffered death. He wished very much to smoke a pipe, as it would be the =
last pipe he should ever smoke in the world. The king could not refuse =
this request, so the soldier took his tinder-box, and struck fire, once, =
twice, thrice,- and there in a moment stood all the dogs;-the one with =
eyes as big as teacups, the one with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and =
the third, whose eyes were like towers. "Help me now, that I may not be =
hanged," cried the soldier.=20
