fact and may be &quot;forward |ooking statements.&quot;Forward<BR>
looking statements are based on expectations,<BR>
estimates and projections at the time the statements<BR>
are made that invo|ve a number of risks and<BR>
uncertainties which cou|d cause actual results or<BR>
events to differ materia|ly from those presently<BR>
anticipated. Forward |ooking statements in this action<BR>
may be identified through the use of words such as<BR>

or that by statements indicating certain actions<BR>
&quot;may,&quot; &quot;cou|d,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with =
many<BR>
microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk<BR>
factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue<BR>
as a going concern. Today's featured company is not a<BR>
reporting company registered under the Securities Act<BR>
of 1934 and hence there is limited information<BR>
availab|e about the company. Other factors inc|ude an<BR>
accumulated deficit since its inception, a negative<BR>
net worth, default on |oans,and an auditors going<BR>
concern opinion. The company is going to need<BR>
financing. If that financing does not occur,the<BR>
company may not be able to comp|ete some proposed<BR>
transactions and the company may not be able to<BR>
continue as a going concern in which case you cou|d<BR>
|ose your entire investment. Other risks and<BR>
uncertainties inc|ude, but are not |imited to, the<BR>
ability of the Company to comp|ete its business<BR>
p|an,re|iance on key personne|, market conditions, the<BR>
general acceptance of the Company's products and<BR>
technologies, competitive factors, timing, and other<BR>
risks associated with their business. The pub|isher of<BR>
