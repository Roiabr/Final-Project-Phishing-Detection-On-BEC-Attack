How can you sell this software as OEM ?It seems too good to be true - is =
there a catch?<BR>
<BR>
There is no catch - the software versions that we sell are OEM (Original =
Equipment Manufacturer)<BR>
which means you will receive the installation CDs only (they do not come =
in their original retail<BR>
packing and do not include the manual). We do guarantee that all =
programs are the 100% full working<BR>
retail versions - no demos or academic versions! When you order, you =
will receive all materials<BR>
required for a complete installation - or your money back! Why pay =
hundreds of dollars more when you<BR>
can get exactly the same but OEM-CD? You don't have to pay that much for =
the fancy box and manuals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why is your software so inexpensive compared to the other retailers?<BR>
<BR>
We minimize our overhead by stocking mostly top selling software only =
and try to get the<BR>
best deals for them. We also sell what are called OEM versions, the same =
software as the<BR>
box version without the box and the manual. By foregoing the fancy box =
and typically slim<BR>
manuals you end up saving a considerable amount.<BR>
<BR>
thank you<BR>
