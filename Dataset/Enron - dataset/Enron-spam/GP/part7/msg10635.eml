Why not, Billy? he said. There are lots of things I could do around here =
without even going near a truck.She's a fighter, my wife. Especially =
when she sees a bully. Once, she took on a cop who was harassing some =
black kids outside the yard. Nearly got herself arrested. Now I thought =
she'd pushed Jim too far.But he didn't come back. He called Frannie =
Petersen, the third member of our old gang from high school, and charmed =
a job out of him, working in his lumber business out in Illinois.Look, I =
don't want to hear it. Why don't you just ease off the gas for tonight? =
Just for tonight. Let's get some steaks and have a pleasant evening.And =
if they don't like it they can quit and set up on their own?Keep it. =
Let's call it an advance on your first paycheck from Harper's.Yeah, he =
said, draining his glass, Blood's thicker than water, huh?We'll call =
you, Cath said. Come and stay.That's enough, I said. I pushed him hard =
into his chair. He flopped back like a broken toy. My heart was racing. =
Little sparks were shooting around the edge of my vision. Cath was =
white. I looked at her and I knew that was the end. I'm sorry, Marion. =
We're leaving. Come on, Cath. I put my arm round her and felt her =
shaking.I wanted to keep it friendly; over the years I'd learned to =
ignore his baited lines, though it still took an effort.Cath laughed and =
that pretty much eased the mood. After we'd been drinking for a while, =
feeling our way back into each other's lives, Cath finished her half =
glass and stood up. I got up too, but she put her hand on my =
shoulder.Yeah, he said, draining his glass, Blood's thicker than water, =
huh?There are clinics...Oh, please.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever met a =
12-stepper? 'One day at a time, Lord.' Jeez, they'd turn a guy to =
drink.He scraped his chair back and got to his feet.<BR>
