<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Greeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
I want to start my first letter from a question: &quot;Is it possible to =
be happy without LOVE?&quot;<BR>
I think that you will agree with me if the answer will be &quot;NO =
WAY&quot;. Love is the most beautiful and exciting thing<BR>
that may happen between man and woman! It inspires us only for doing =
positive things towards each other.<BR>
One very famous writer said: &quot;The beauty will rescue the =
world&quot; i agree with his words but still i would add :<BR>
&quot; LOVE and Beauty will rescure the world&quot;.<BR>
I hope you agree with me that Love is a big notion.<BR>
There's love to&nbsp; God, to Mother, to a child to the country where =
you were born, and there's love that joins a man<BR>
and woman for all their life. That is the LOVE i'm looking for! And i'm =
seeking for the man who is also eager to have<BR>
this life long adventure full of surprises and new experience we can =
share together! Will you join me for this trip?<BR>
I do realise that it should be very difficult to say &quot;Yes&quot; =
from the first letter having no idea about me.<BR>
That's why i just offer to get to know each other better though =
correspondence that will help us to reveal many things<BR>
about each other whether we mach perfectly or not. In addition you can =
look at my pictures and read some info about me here<BR>
<A =
HREF=3D"http://9aCwCL2nRC.my-details.org/">http://9aCwCL2nRC.my-details.o=
rg/</A><BR>
I hope you'll like what you see and read there.<BR>
Well closing my first letter to you i just want to thank you for reading =
it and i really hope that you'll share<BR>
my point of view on what i said above. I do really hope that you'll =
answer me soon.<BR>
<BR>
talk to you soon.....<BR>
