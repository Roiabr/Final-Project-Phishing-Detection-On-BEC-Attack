What is Vicodin used for?<BR>
<BR>
Vicodin is the brand name for the popular painkiller, hydrocodone =
bitartrate and acetaminophen.<BR>
Hydrocodone bitartrate is an opioid analgesic and antitussive, occurring =
as fine, white crystals<BR>
or, as a crystalline powder.<BR>
In the U.S. there are over 200 products containing hydrocodone, =
typically combined with acetaminophen<BR>
(Vicodin, Lortab). However, it is also combined with aspirin (Lortab =
ASA), ibuprofen (Vicoprofen),<BR>
and antihistamines (Hycomine). Both tablet and liquid forms of =
hydrocodone are available (Tussionex).<BR>
Other brand names include Anexsia, CoGesic, Hydrocet, Hy-Phen, Lorcet, =
Maxidone, Norco, Panacet, and Zydone.<BR>
Street names for Vicodin include vikes and hydros.<BR>

1.Background:<BR>
<BR>
Hydrocodone dates back to the 1920's when Knoll, a German pharmaceutical =
company, believed hydrogenizing<BR>
codeine could make it less toxic, making it easier on the stomach. As =
its name implies, hydrocodone is the<BR>
codeine molecule with a hydrogen atom attached. During this time in the =
U.S., a disturbing percentage of middle<BR>
class Americans were hooked on opium derivatives. The government, =
anxious for a non-addictive painkiller,<BR>
gave extensive funding to research new compounds like hydrocodone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
2.Indications:<BR>
<BR>
Vicodin is a phenathrene-derivate opiate agonist, effective both as an =
antitussive (anti-cough) agent, and as<BR>
an opiate, an effective analgesic for mild to moderate pain. Five mg of =
hydrocodone is equivalent to 30 mg of<BR>
codeine when administered orally. 15 mg (1/4 gr) of hydrocodone is =
considered equivalent to 10 mg (1/6 gr) of<BR>
morphine. Hydrocodone is considered to be like morphine in all =
respects.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3.Effects:<BR>
<BR>
Vicodin is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic and antitussive with =
multiple actions qualitatively similar to<BR>
those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and =
smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of<BR>
action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known, although it is =
believed to relate to the existence of opiate<BR>
receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, =
narcotics may produce euphoria; drowsiness;<BR>
lethargy; relaxation; difficulty in concentrating; decreased physical =
activity in some users and increased physical<BR>
activity in others; mild anxiety or fear, and pupillary =
constriction.<BR>
<BR>
4.How can our prices be so low?:<BR>
<BR>
We ship directly from FDA - approved manufacturer in India where the =
production costs are low.<BR>
The branded versions of the product are more expensive because other =
companies spend a lot on marketing.However,<BR>
our quality is the same as that of the branded drugs.Providing quality =
is where we spend our budget. We don't<BR>
think that marketing is that important if the product works.Besides, =
there are no middlemen, when you buy directly<BR>
from the manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
All packages are shipped discreetly by Airmail WORLDWIDE.<BR>
