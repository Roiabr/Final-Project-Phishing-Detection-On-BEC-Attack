<P>I am Mr. Duke Abby Peters. I am the personal accountant to a national =

(Fixed)Deposit for Twelve calendar months, valued at US$15,500,000.00
(Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in a Reputable Bank in =
Lagos
Nigeria. </P>
<P>On June 6, 2000, My client, his wife and their three children were
involved in a car accident along Airport Road. All occupants of the =
vehicle
unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries =
to
your embassy and international trade missions to locate any of my =
customer
extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. After these =
several
unsuccessful attempts, to locate any member of his family hence I =
contacted
you. </P>
<P>I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money and property =
left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared =
unserviceable by
the bank where this huge deposit were lodged. Particularly, the
Investigation Department of the bank where the deceased had an account
valued US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) =
have
issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account
confiscated within the next ten official working days. </P>
<P>Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3 =
years
now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the =
deceased
since you have the same last name, so that the proceeds of this account
valued at $15.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me =
can
share the money 60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary =
Informations
that can be used to back up any claim we may make. This money
(US$15,500,000.00) is still lying in the Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will =
ever
come forward to claim it. And according to Laws of Federal Republic of
Nigeria, at the expiration of 5(five) years, the money will revert to =
the
ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the =
fund.
