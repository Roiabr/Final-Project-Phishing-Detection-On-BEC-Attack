Senticore to Take LoboGaming Public<BR>
Tuesday July 12, 7:00 am ET<BR>
<BR>
The Board of Directors of Senticore, Inc. (OTC<BR>
BB:SNIO.OB - News), a publicly traded holding company,<BR>
has agreed to assist one of its holdings, LoboGaming<BR>
Corporation, to become a publicly traded company on a<BR>
US exchange.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We believe LoboGaming's listing as a publicly traded<BR>
company is highly beneficial for a young company in a<BR>
rapid growth stage,&quot; said Senticore CEO Jay Patel. &quot;In<BR>
addition, shareholders such as Senticore will be able<BR>
to obtain liquidity in their investment, while<BR>
LoboGaming will be in a position to raise ample<BR>
capital to fund its operations and future growth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The company has reported their preference is to obtain<BR>
public status through a reverse merger with either an<BR>
OTC Bulletin Board or Pink Sheet company. A formal<BR>
announcement with a possible suitor is expected in the<BR>
coming month.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Please Watch This One Trade. These little stocks can<BR>
surge higher quickly sometimes....As Some of You<BR>
Already Know.....Go SNIO!<BR>

actions &quot;may,&quot; &quot;could,&quot; or &quot;might&quot;<BR>
occur. As with many micr0cap st0cks, today's company<BR>
has additional risk factors that raise<BR>
doubt about its ability to continue as a going<BR>
concern. Those factors include, but are not<BR>
limited to: No operating history, a n0minal cash<BR>
position, n0 revenue in its m0st recent quarter, an<BR>
accumulated deficit since its inception, a negative<BR>
net worth, a going concern opinion from its auditor,<BR>
and a reliance on loans from shareholders, related and<BR>
unrelated parties to pay expenses. The publicly<BR>
available float is currently increasing and is<BR>
dilutive to you. The company is not currently an<BR>
operating company.&nbsp; The company is going to need<BR>
financing. If that financing does not occur,the<BR>
company&nbsp; may not be able to complete some pending<BR>
transactions and may not be able to continue as a<BR>
going concern in which case you could lose your entire<BR>
inv3stment.The Company is regist3red under the<BR>
in-v3stment c0mpany act of 1940 as a business<BR>
development company and has not had business<BR>
operations for two years. Other risks and<BR>
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the<BR>
ability of the Company to complete its business<BR>
plan,reliance on key personnel, market conditions, the<BR>
general acceptance of the Company's pr0ducts and<BR>
technologies, competitive factors, timing, and other<BR>
risks associated with their business. The publisher of<BR>
