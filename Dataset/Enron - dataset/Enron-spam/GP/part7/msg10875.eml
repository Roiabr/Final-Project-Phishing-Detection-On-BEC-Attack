Best stoc-k for Year 2005 - read the story and you will see for =
yourself<BR>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<B=
R>
<BR>
Are you tired of Public Companies without anything substantial backing =
their story - how about a revolutionary invention that will change the =
Security industry forever,&nbsp; and the company just went public!!!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Company Name: Sniffex inc<BR>
Ticker: SNFX<BR>
<BR>
We profiled this stoc-k 1 month ago when it was at $1 and we said DONT =
BUY UNLESS YOU ARE LONG TERM PLAYER, we projected $5-10 should be seen =
soon and since then the stoc-k went to $3.4 high and is now steadily =
trading like $500k or more every day at $2.80 range.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The company has the most sensitive explosive detection device in the =
world and now after what happened in London 10 days ago this sector is =
the hottest on the stoc-k market.<BR>
<BR>
We believe Sniffex will start selling their devices very soon to all =
security forces around the world simply because their device can find =
even 100 grams of almost any type of explosive from 30-50 yards maybe =
even more and even through walls or metal shield.<BR>
We strongly believe once everybody on the stoc-k market realize what a =
gem SNFX then its possible for this stoc-k to see $10-20 levels.<BR>
<BR>
Rating: Strong Buy<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Industry: Security, Homeland Security, Cargo Screening and Explosion =
Detection Systems<BR>
<BR>
RECENT NEWS: Sniffex, Inc. Announces International Marketing Program<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
DO NOT BUY THIS stoc-k if you want to just play it for a few days, this =
issue will bring best returns only for long term investors who realize =
the potential of the company and the fact that 2-3 contracts on =
government level could skyrocket the stoc-k price above $10-20.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Reason for the TOP 2005 Rating: Unique Explosive Detection Device =
Capable of finding its targets from tens or hundreds of meters!!! There =
is no other EDS device which is so powerful that can locate almost any =
explosive behind concrete walls from distance of tens of meters!!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Competition: There are many companies in the industry of Sniffing =
explosives, some of them are public and they are companies like iSON =
HWPR or HiET and all of them have devices which can locate explosive =
from 10 inches, 1 feet, 2 feet or close to that.<BR>
Compared to these results SN FX device is tens of times better and =
smaller in size and yet CHEAPER!!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;SNFX announced the release of sniffex Version 1.1, a handheld =
explosives detection device which the Company claims can locate =
nitro-based explosives from a distance of 10 to 100 feet depending on =
the quantity of the explosive and environmental conditions.<BR>
The Company also stated that, to the best of their knowledge, sniffex is =
the first device of its kind that can operate from such distances and =
find exp losives behind barriers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Could this company be amongst the top deals on wallstreet this year!!! =
YES its trading at only $2.8 now and this brand new stoc-k could be =
$10-20 easily in the next few months as the story unfolds!!<BR>
<BR>
DO NOT BUY THIS stoc-k if you want to just play it for a few days, this =
issue will bring best returns only for long term investors who realize =
the potential of the company and the fact that 2-3 contracts on =
government level could skyrocket the stoc-k price above $10.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
SNFX is in process of presenting the new device in USA and to Worldwide =
Markets and as soon as they receive some substantial orders and feedback =
from big institutional clients, this stoc-k will fly in the skies,<BR>
as an example iSON traded almost 1 billion dollars after they announced =
they are in process of developing some device, and SNFX already has the =
device and it proved it works in numerous tests!!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recent News announcement from the company: Sniffex, Inc. (SNFX) =
(&quot;Sniffex&quot;), producers of Sniffex, an explosive detection =
device, announced today the results of a new international marketing =
campaign that includes Asia, Australia, and the Middle East.<BR>

10 countries and that discussions have already begun on distribution =
agreements in several of those countries.<BR>
The company further stated that they have had significant direct =
interest from US government agencies and several foreign =
governments.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our progress as a new company has been steadily accelerating. The =
events of July 7, 2005 in London have further increased the interest in =
Sniffex and in our company's future products.<BR>
We believe we are at the forefront of providing new tools for =
effectively fighting the international war on terror,&quot; stated Paul =
