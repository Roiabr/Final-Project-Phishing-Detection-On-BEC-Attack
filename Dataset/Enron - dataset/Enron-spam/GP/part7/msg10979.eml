<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear<BR>
I got your email address from&nbsp; the internet and please do<BR>
not feel bad about this message more especially as i am<BR>
from Iraq. I am a widow of one of the former senior<BR>
managers of the Iraqi State Oil Organisation in charge<BR>
of the United Nations Oil-For-Food Programme.<BR>
My Husband and three of our four children were killed<BR>
in the U.S. led military campaign during this crises<BR>
period leaving my little daughter. Before the dead<BR>
of my husband,he reveal to me that he deposited a<BR>
luggage containing 12 million usa dollars as family<BR>
valuables with a local security company here in baghdad.<BR>
What i want is that i need you to help me<BR>
recieve this luggage when it arrive Europe.<BR>
The security company has agreed to help transfer<BR>
the luggage to Europe and that i need somebody<BR>
to recieve it for me since i am not free to travel now.<BR>
Please note that this doesnt involve any risk.<BR>
All i need from you is honesty and a promise<BR>
not to betray me after you recieve the luggage.<BR>
Please note that i have decided to take this risk<BR>
because the new iraq government is investigating<BR>
all the managers that work at the oil for food<BR>
program and i stand to lose all the fund if i<BR>
dont relocate them.<BR>
Note that for security reason,i will not disclose<BR>
my identity until you respond to this mail.I look<BR>
forward to hear from you soon and i will provide<BR>
you with more details.<BR>
Thank you.&nbsp; </FONT>
