Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is still awaiting =

Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =

market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potentia|ly worth multi-millions, MOGI is se|ling for less<BR>
than 1/4 the value of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. =
Already<BR>
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa||<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
exp|orers and developers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made =
