Bertha was a very pretty girl. Quite a lot of young men wanted to =
marry<BR>
her, but she was not satisfied with any of&nbsp; them. One day, one of =
the young<BR>
men came to visit her and asked her to become his wife. She answered, =
&quot;No,<BR>

does<BR>

and went to<BR>

&quot;It<BR>
isn't a man you're looking for. It's a television set.&quot;<BR>

quietly<BR>

the sky and a<BR>
voice boomed out, &quot;No, you are not screwed. Pick up that stone at =
your feet<BR>
and bash in the head of the chief standing in front of you.&quot; So the =
explorer<BR>
picked up the stone and proceeded to bash the life out of the chief. =
He<BR>
stood above the lifeless body, breathing heavily, surrounded by 100 =
natives<BR>
with looks of shock on their faces. The voice boomed out again, =
&quot;Okay, now<BR>
you're screwed.&quot;<BR>
