<p>Dear Wells Fargo Customer,</p>

<p>To provide our customers the most effective and secure online access =
to their accounts, we are continually upgrading our online services. As =
we add new features and enhancements to our service, there are certain =
browser versions, which will not support these system upgrades.  As many =
customers already know, Microsoft Internet Explorer has significant =
'holes' or vulnerabilities that virus creators can easily take advantage =
of.</p>

<p>In order to further protect your account, we have introduced some new =
important security standards and browser requirements. Wells Fargo =
security systems require that you test your browser now to see if it =
meets the requirements for Wells Fargo Online or Wells Fargo Business =
Online banking.</p>
