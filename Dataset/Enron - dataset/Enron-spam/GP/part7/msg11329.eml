Distribution Gr0up, Inc. &quot;VDG,&quot; forming a revolutionary new =
music company,<BR>
Controversial Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting =
of<BR>

a<BR>
33% stake in the new company.<BR>
<BR>

Angeles and will change its corporate name to Controversial =
Entertainment<BR>
Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to complete =
and<BR>
execute the definitive agreement by July 8th, 2005, and seek =
shareholder<BR>
approval immediately thereafter.<BR>
<BR>
Pop3's CEO, John D. Aquilino, stated, &quot;This alliance will allow =
Pop3 to<BR>
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music<BR>

Roxxy's management team combines highly experienced industry =
executives<BR>
drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in-house<BR>

today.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the =
major<BR>
labels' lack of commitment to their artists and customers; labels =
that<BR>
cast aside established artists who can no longer generate =

that can easily generate revenues between $1 and $5 milli0n per =
title,&quot;<BR>
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Additionally, the acquisition of VDG will provide us with the =
ability<BR>
to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22,000 =
retail<BR>
location in North America, effectively doubling the Company's net<BR>
profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our<BR>
artists.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Shebanow concluded, &quot;While there are smaller labels that do =
provide<BR>
a home for these acts, they lack either the will or financial =
resources<BR>
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we =
have<BR>
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great<BR>
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and =
the<BR>
customer that Controversial Entertainment will possess.&quot;<BR>
