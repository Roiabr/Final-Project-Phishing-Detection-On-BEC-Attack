My legs are really hairy. I have no difficulty in starting or holding my =
bowel movement. Heut will wince when a woman tries to clean his wounds. =
You're very likely to survive any battle in any war. We must polish the =
Polish furniture.
Upon seeing the tear in the painting I shed a tear. Rather than wasting =
bullets, megalomaniacs prefer to kill their enemies using complex =
machinery. People are always watching me. The only time you're standing =
still is during an earthquake. They were too close to the door to close =
it.

Interviewee wore a Walkman, explaining that she could listen to the =
interviewer and the music at the same time. Unless you make the mistake =
of showing someone a  picture of your sweetheart back home. It's easy to =
land a plane, providing there is someone in the control tower to talk =
you down. A police detective can only solve a case after he has been =
suspended from duty. I think that Lincoln was greater than Washington.
Who is their total opposite. Large, loft apartments in New York City are =
plentiful and affordable, even if the tenants are unemployed. So you =
know exactly when they're going to go off. People are always watching =
me. When you turn out the light to go to bed, everything in your bedroom =
will still be clearly visible but slightly blue.
"Why am I here?" Applicant refused to sit down and insisted on being =
interviewed standing up. My legs are really hairy. There was a row among =
the oarsmen about how to row. "Does your company have a policy regarding =
concealed weapons?"
You haven't blinked since the last lunar eclipse. I like tall women. =
There was a row among the oarsmen about how to row. You've built a =
miniature city out of little plastic stirrers. People are always =
watching me.
