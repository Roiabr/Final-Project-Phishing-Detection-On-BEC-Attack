<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Once upon a time, a blonde became so sick of hearing =
blonde jokes that she had her hair cut and dyed brown.<BR>
<BR>
A few days later, as she was out driving around the countryside, she =
stopped her car to let a flock of sheep pass.<BR>
<BR>
Admiring the cute wooly creatures, she said to the shepherd, &quot;If I =
can guess how many sheep you have, can I take one?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The shepherd, always the gentleman, said, &quot;Sure!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The blonde thought for a moment and, for no discernible reason, said, =
&quot;352.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This being the correct number, the shepherd was, understandably, totally =
amazed, and exclaimed, &quot;You're right! O.K., I'll keep to my end of =
the deal. Take your pick of my flock.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The blonde carefully considered the entire flock and finally picked the =
one that was by far cuter and more playful than any of the others.<BR>
<BR>
When she was done, the shepherd turned to her and said, &quot;O.K., now =
I have a proposition for you. If I can guess your true hair color, can I =
have my dog back?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
