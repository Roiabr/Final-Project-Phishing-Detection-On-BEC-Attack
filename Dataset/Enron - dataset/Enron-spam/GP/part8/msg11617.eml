above, not on things on the earth. [Colossians 3:2]<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My way of joking is to tell =
the truth. It's the funniest joke in the world.<BR>
You'll be amazed at how many clueless music star wannabes show up at our =
door.<BR>
Some of these fresh chicks will do anything it takes to get =
famous...<BR>
<BR>
Imaginary evils soon become real one by indulging our reflections on =
them.This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really =
love the more they give, the more they possess.<BR>
