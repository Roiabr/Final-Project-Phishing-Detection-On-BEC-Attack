The statements by the dog handlers provide the clearest indication yet =
that military intelligence personnel were deeply involved in tactics =
later deemed by a U.S. Army general to be "sadistic, blatant and wanton =
criminal abuses."
President Bush and top Pentagon officials have said the criminal abuse =
at Abu Ghraib was confined to a small group of rogue military police =
soldiers who stripped detainees naked, beat them and photographed them =
in humiliating sexual poses. An Army investigation into the abuse =
condemned the MPs for those practices, but also included the use of =
unmuzzled dogs to frighten detainees among the "intentional abuse."
So far, the only charges to emerge have been against seven MPs and do =
not include any dog incidents, even though such use of dogs is an =
apparent violation of the Geneva Conventions and the Army's field =
manual. The military intelligence officer in charge of Abu Ghraib later =
told investigators that the use of unmuzzled dogs in interrogation =
sessions was recommended by a two-star general and that it was "okay."
The newly obtained documents reinforce the picture that the abuse falls =
into two categories: sexual humiliation and beatings at the hands of =
MPs, and intimidation using dogs that is clearly tied to military =
intelligence. The sexual abuse happened weeks and even months before the =
dog incidents, some of which appear to be part of an organized strategy =
by military intelligence to scare detainees into talking, according to =
the statements.
