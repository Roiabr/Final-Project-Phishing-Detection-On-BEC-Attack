Hi Varou,=20
<p>
There are several types of clinical depression which involve =
disturbances in mood, concentration, self-confidence, sleep, appetite, =
activity and behavior as well as disruptions in friendships, family, =
work and/or school. A clinical depression is different than the =
experiences of sadness, disappointment and grief familiar to everyone, =
however, which can make it difficult to determine when professional help =
is necessary. This brochure is intended to provide you with an =
understanding of the symptoms, causes, and treatment of clinical =
depression and allow you to assess the severity of symptoms you are =
experiencing to determine whether you should consider treatment at this =
time.
<p>
We take the risk out of finding a safe place to make your online medical =
decisions. your health, safety, and shopping experience are very =
important to us.
<p>
No prior Rx is required.. <a =
