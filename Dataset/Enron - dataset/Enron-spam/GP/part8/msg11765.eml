Watch This Stock Monday! A Large promotional Campaign<BR>
is Underway This Weekend. Some of These Little Oil and<BR>
Gas Stocks Have Been Really Moving Lately. And When<BR>
Some of them Move, They Really Go...Gains of 100%,<BR>
200% or More Are Not Unheard Of. U-C-P-I and X-C-H-C are Two<BR>
Examples..<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Reasons To Consider (E O G I):<BR>
<BR>
*Emerson Oil &amp; Gas holds a 50% working interest in the<BR>
W.T. Davis well and lands within Township 23 North and<BR>
Range 13 West of Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The net<BR>
revenue interest of the lease is 75%. The W.T. Davis<BR>
Well is located in the Arkana Field and initially<BR>
produced from the Haynesville Formation of the Cotton<BR>
Valley Series. With the worldwide focus on energy<BR>
needs being front and center in the public eye,<BR>
Emerson feels that with its first class management and<BR>
discretionary project choices, the company will<BR>
continue to serve its shareholders well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Emerson is Identifying additional step out<BR>
opportunities on its Louisiana property.<BR>
<BR>
*Emerson has signed a letter of intent to earn 50%<BR>
working interest in the Rinsland well and Lease in<BR>
Bossier Parish Louisiana.<BR>
<BR>
*Emerson's North-West Louisiana drilling efforts<BR>
follow closely to its philosophy of high-potential low<BR>
risk re-entry projects in developed fields. By<BR>
maintaining this conservative, but revenue driven<BR>
philosophy and mission statement, Emerson enables<BR>
itself to build a strong revenue base for the company<BR>
and its shareholders, while taking the lowest possible<BR>
risk in achieving this goal.<BR>

events or performance are not statements of historical<BR>

looking statements are based on expectations,<BR>
estimates and projections at the time the statements<BR>
are made that involve a number of risks and<BR>
uncertainties which could cause actual results or<BR>
events to differ materially from those presently<BR>
anticipated. Forward looking statements in this action<BR>
may be identified through the use of words such as<BR>
&quot;projects&quot;, &quot;foresee&quot;, &quot;expects&quot;, =

&quot;understands&quot;<BR>
or that by statements indicating certain actions<BR>
&quot;may,&quot; &quot;could,&quot; or &quot;might&quot; occur. As with =
many<BR>
microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk<BR>
factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue<BR>
as a going concern. Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. is not a<BR>
reporting company registered under the Securities Act<BR>
of 1934 and hence there is limited public information<BR>
available about the company. Other factors include:<BR>
the company had no revenue in its most recent quarter<BR>
and is not currently revenue producing.The company has<BR>
a nominal cash position. The company is going to need<BR>
financing to complete some business transactions and<BR>
begin revenue producing. If that financing does not<BR>
occur, the company may not be able to continue as a<BR>
going concern in which case you could lose your entire<BR>
investment. Other factors include general economic and<BR>
business conditions, the ability to acquire and<BR>
develop specific projects, the ability to fund<BR>
operations and changes in consumer and business<BR>
consumption habits and other factors over which<BR>
Emerson Oil and Gas Inc. has little or no control. The<BR>
