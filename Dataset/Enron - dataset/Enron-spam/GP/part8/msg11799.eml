<BR>
Oretech is poised to make huge profits in the booming mining =
industry.&nbsp;<BR>
If you have been following the markets lately, then you know that<BR>
mining stocks are HOT.&nbsp; Oretech is a company with a unique =
opportunity to<BR>
capitalize off this red hot sector!<BR>
<BR>
The company has developed and tested their ore processing technology<BR>
that utilizes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract<BR>
specific minerals (gold and silver) from ore bodies. Unlike =
conventional<BR>
processes ORTE does NOT use harmful chemicals, discharge polluted water =
or<BR>
environmentally unsafe gases. The process is environment friendly, =
cost<BR>
effective and produces higher yields of recovered materials.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER ORTE***<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
* ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN UP - This sector would pay ORTE to clean up =
old<BR>
mining waste tailing piles that are leaching poisons into =
surrounding<BR>
ground water. Revenues are enhanced by selling recovered precious =
metals.<BR>
<BR>
* EXTRACT 100% OF THE CRUDE OIL FROM TAR SANDS - Tests demonstrate =
ORTE<BR>
producing TWICE the yields of conventional methods. This application<BR>
has significant potential that would produce new immense investment<BR>
interest in ORTE stock.<BR>
<BR>
* ORTE CAN RAPIDLY GENERATE REVENUES and corporate growth by =
licensing<BR>
their technology to equipment manufacturers, mining companies, oil<BR>
companies and Joint Venture partners. This would give ORTE upfront =
revenues<BR>
and royalty income, industry and investment attention and favorable<BR>
news.<BR>
<BR>
* RECENTLY DISCOVERED OPPORTUNITY - ORTE has developed, tested and<BR>
proven the effectiveness of their technology. Companies dealing in =
mining<BR>
and oil recovery, tailings waste cleanup, and environmental clean up<BR>
know about ORTE and the effectiveness of their breakthrough process. =
The<BR>
company is now set to go into a stage of explosive business =
expansion.<BR>
This should generate the type of Wall Street investment attention =
that<BR>
would quickly drive share prices upward.<BR>
<BR>
Oretech is set to produce some BIG NEWS on new business and =
technology<BR>
licensing Joint Ventures that could send share prices soaring.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 2005--Oretech, Inc. (Pink<BR>

stated<BR>
that initial results indicate significantly improved performance in =
two<BR>
specific areas:<BR>
<BR>
a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY:<BR>
<BR>
Toxic chemicals normally found in mine tailings are significantly<BR>
eliminated during the Oretech's process of precious metals =
extraction<BR>
(Gold/Silver/Titanium/Platinum).&nbsp; The SPS (Shehane Proprietary =
System)<BR>
technology can provide one of the most environmentally friendly =
mining<BR>
solutions, while being extremely cost effective.<BR>
<BR>
b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS:<BR>
<BR>
With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy =
consumption<BR>
utilizing SPS technology significantly lowers operating costs<BR>
associated with precious metal extraction.<BR>
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining<BR>
companies with a view to licensing SPS technology particularly for =
mining<BR>
operations in environmentally sensitive regions of North America.<BR>
<BR>
