From: Mr James Ugan<BR>
E-mail:jamesugan@netscape.net<BR>
Attn: President/CEO<BR>
Dear Sir,<BR>
I am jamesugan, Bank Manager; Long Term Fixed Deposit Department, of =
Tradevco Bank of Liberia. I have an urgent and very confidential =
business proposition for you.<BR>
On June, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Liberian =
Mining Corporation, Mr. Ron Williams made a numbered time (Fixed) =
Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,200,000.00 (Fourteen =
Million, Two Hundred Thousand United States<BR>
Dollars) in my branch.<BR>
Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address =
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we =
discovered from his contract employers, the Liberian Mining Corporation =
that Mr. Ron Williams died from an automobi<BR>
le accident.<BR>
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL =
and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.<BR>
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Ron<BR>
Williams did not declare any kin or relations in all his official =
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of =
US$14,200,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being =
rolled over with the principal sum at the end<BR>
of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.<BR>
According to Liberian Financial Law of unclaimed deposit, at the =
expiration of 5 {five) years, the funds will be transferred to Treasury =
Account with the Federal Reserve Bank as free funds for the =
Government.<BR>
Consequently, the need to contact you in order to stand in as the next =
of kin to Mr. Ron Williams so that the fruits of this old man's labour =
will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This =
is legal, simple and clear.<BR>
I will like you to provide immediately your full name and<BR>
address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and =
affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin/beneficiary to =
his estate.<BR>
We shall employ the service of an accredited Attorney for drafting and =
notarization of the ?Will? and to obtain the necessary documents and =
letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank =
account in any part of the world, which you<BR>
will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as =
the beneficiary/next of kin.<BR>
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of =
60% for me and 40% for you.<BR>
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will =
be done by the Attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees =
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, =
please reply immediately via email address<BR>
above.<BR>
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and =
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.<BR>
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this<BR>
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall =
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.<BR>
Awaiting your urgent reply.<BR>
Best regards<BR>
James&nbsp; Ugan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
