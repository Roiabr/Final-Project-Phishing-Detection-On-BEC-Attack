Dear Sir.Madam,<BR>
<BR>
My name is PRINCE DUMONT ELOY, I am the operational<BR>
<BR>
manager in account management section incharge of<BR>
<BR>
credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks<BR>
<BR>
here in South Africa.I am writing in respect of a<BR>
<BR>
foreign customer of my bank who perished with his<BR>
<BR>
whole families on 25TH July, 2000 in CONCORDE PLANE<BR>
<BR>
CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers<BR>
<BR>
aboard.<BR>
<BR>
There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by<BR>
<BR>
this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a<BR>
<BR>
written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account.<BR>
<BR>
Since his death, I personally has watched with keen<BR>
<BR>
interest to see the next of kin but all has proved<BR>
<BR>
abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and<BR>
<BR>
no other person knows about this account or<BR>
<BR>
anything concerning it,the account has no other<BR>
<BR>
beneficiary<BR>
and until his death he was the manager of his<BR>
<BR>
company.<BR>
<BR>
The total amount involved is $16,000,000.00<BR>
<BR>
USD.[Sixteen Million nited States Dollar]. We wish<BR>
<BR>
to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00[Six<BR>
<BR>
million] and upon successful transaction without<BR>
<BR>
any disappointment&nbsp; from your side, we shall<BR>
<BR>
re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance<BR>
<BR>
to your account.<BR>
<BR>
I have secretly discussed this matter with the<BR>
<BR>
general manager of the bank who I must involve in<BR>
<BR>
order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of<BR>
<BR>
the fund to any foreign bank account which you are<BR>
<BR>
going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek<BR>
<BR>
for a reliable foreigner who will act as the<BR>
<BR>
foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased<BR>
<BR>
by providing his/her bank account where the fund<BR>
<BR>
will be transferred for immediate investment on any<BR>
<BR>
viable project as no one has come up to be the next<BR>
<BR>
of kin.<BR>
<BR>
The banking ethics here does not allow such money<BR>
<BR>
to stay more than six years without claim hence the<BR>
<BR>
money will be recalled to the government treasury<BR>
<BR>
as unclaimed after this long period of domancy.<BR>
<BR>
In view of this I got your contact through my<BR>
<BR>
personal search to see if you can assist by<BR>
<BR>
providing your safe bank account for the transfer<BR>
<BR>
or find a reliable person who will be capable of<BR>
<BR>
receiving such amount in his or her personal<BR>
<BR>
account. At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of<BR>
<BR>
the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the<BR>
<BR>
total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa<BR>
<BR>
and in your country while the remaining 5% will be<BR>
<BR>
set aside to settle expenses both parties might<BR>
<BR>
incure during the transfer process.<BR>
<BR>
Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you<BR>
<BR>
a detailed information about the transaction. I<BR>
<BR>
will not fail to bring to your notice that this<BR>
<BR>
business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you<BR>
<BR>
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for<BR>
<BR>
fund transfer<BR>
can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after<BR>
<BR>
you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the<BR>
<BR>
fund from the deceased.<BR>
<BR>
When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an<BR>
<BR>
e-mail or you can call me or fax me. You should<BR>
<BR>
also include your private fax and phone numbers for<BR>
<BR>
easy and safe communication.<BR>
<BR>
Respectfully yours,<BR>
PRINCE DUMONT ELOY.<BR>
