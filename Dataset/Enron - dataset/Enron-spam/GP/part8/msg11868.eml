FROM: MR JACOB BONGANI<BR>
TEL: +27-83-507-6778<BR>
<BR>
Good day<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;You may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you don't =
know me personally. I am Mr.Jacob Bongani the son of Dr. Simon =
Bongani,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got =
your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in =
my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very =
confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign =
account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few =
black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of =
the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support =
and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white =
minority.<BR>
&nbsp; Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to =
deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred =
Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as =
if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin =
a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. =
This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical =
for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and =
Swaziland.<BR>
This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new =
land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks =
vehemently condemned the &quot;modus operandi&quot; adopted by the =
government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war =
veterans and some political thugs.<BR>
&nbsp;precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been =
killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United =
States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. =
Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has =
continously supported Mugabe's new land act, it is against this =
background that I and my family who are currently residing in South =
Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign =
account.<BR>
&nbsp; As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the =
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money =
could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are =
tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government =
seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of =
investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same =
experience in future since both countries have almost the same political =
history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not =
allow such investment hence we are seeking for an =
&quot;ASYLUM&quot;.<BR>
&nbsp; As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my =
family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% =
risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily =
matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% =
for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we =
may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest =
ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice.<BR>
Finally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on =
this money when it finally gets to your personal or company's account in =
your country.<BR>
&nbsp;If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your =
interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-507-6778 or E-MAIL to the =
above address.<BR>
Best Regards.<BR>
Jacob Bongani(For the Family).<BR>
