<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear,<BR>
For the attention of: Managing Director/C.E.O.<BR>
<BR>
I write not only to introduce myself to you, but also tender a joint =
investment business proposal for your considerations and acceptance. I =
know that receipt of this mail shall be a great surprise to you =
considering the fact that we did not know each other or had any business =
negotiations before now.<BR>
<BR>
I am also aware of the fact that there is a lot of fraudulent business =
proposals circulating around the world, particularly scam letters =
originating mostly from African countries. which makes it imperative for =
one to be extremly careful before accepting and venturing any business =
proposal from unfamilier person like me. I however, pray your respected =
self not to allow the above unatural abnomalities to influence your =
decision to accept my genuine proposal and intentions which undoubtedly =
would be of immense mutual benefits to both of us. I pledge to you for =
urgent and dedicated attention which this issue deserves.<BR>
<BR>
I am Engr. James Dowell from Liberia. I was born in the year 1970 and =
hold a Msc. degree in chemical engineering from university of Monrovia. =
Before my resignation last week in my working place, I was a head of =
department in Printing and Minting Security Co. of Liberia. My =
resignation from office is as a result of my intention to go into =
private business with you using the capital I have at my disposal now. =
Prior to employment with Printing &amp; Minting Security Co of Liberia, =
I was a one of the trusted aids of ex president Charles Taylor who was =
forced to exile by Economic Community of West African States peace =
keeping forces in conjunction with United Nations peace keeping forces =
as a way to restore peace in a civil war turn country-Liberia for =
years.<BR>
<BR>
My former boss recently contacted me with information that he personally =
deposited some items in five safe trunks with a security company in =
Monrovia. He forwarded the deposit documents to me by DHL with =
instructions to claim the items on his behalf and send four of the cases =
to him while I should retain one as a gift for my honesty and loyalty to =
him during his turbulent tenure in office.<BR>
The four cases have been sent through his network arrangement to his =
exile country. I opened my own case to surprisely discover that it =
contains the sum of US$20,000,000.00 packed and arrangement in such a =
way that it would be difficult to identity it as money. My ex boss =
warned that I should not expose this issue as neither the management of =
the security company nor the present regime in Liberia knows about the =
money otherwise it would be confiscated by present government as it =
would be considered as part of the returns from sales of Liberia Gold. I =
am not surprise because the deposit documents stated that the cases =
contain phographic materials instead of money. By advise of my boss, I =
resigned from office, moved the money to neighbouring country which is =
Senegal where I am temporarily staying in a hotel.<BR>
<BR>
The money is presently in safe custody of a friend whom I met on my way =
to Senegal. The gentle man assisted me at the border on my way to =
Senegal. The customs at the border threatened to confiscate the case if =
I do not offer them some tips even though they did not dictect or know =
that it is money. They insisted that the content would be taken to lab =
to confirm that it is photographic materials as I claim. The man whom I =
later understand that he is a diplomat with Gambia embassy here in =
Senegal loaned me some money which I used to settle the custom men at =
the border. I voluntarily asked the diplomat to keep the case in his =
custody as collataral pending when I pay him back. I purposely ask him =
to keep the trunk for safety reasons and not because he loaned me =
money.<BR>
<BR>
I am therefore seeking your assistance in the following ways.<BR>
<BR>
1.To come down to Senegal in person for a face to face meeting which =
shall make us know each other better and build trust needed in this kind =
of cooperation.<BR>
2. You shall stand as the owner of this money so that we can easily move =
it to your country without questions from authorities over here. As a =
poor income earner, It would be difficult for me to move this money out =
as the beneficiary without proper proof of how I earned it. You as an =
expertrait business personality only need to state that you intended to =
invest the money in Senegal but has now decided otherwise hence the =
reason to repatrate your money back to your country.<BR>
<BR>
I chose your country for the investment because of its stable economy =
and polity.<BR>
2. You shall advise and guide me on a lucrative business to invest the =
money. I would prefer a joint venture with you.<BR>
<BR>
I have mapped out 30% of the total money as your commission for the =
above mentioned contributions. On your arrival, I will go and collect =
the trunk box from the diplomat.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you in advance for your anticipated acceptance of this proposal.I =
wish you send me a reply immediately as soon as you recieve this =
proposal through my private email box; jamesdowell3@yahoo.co.uk =
&lt;/ym/Compose?To=3Djamesdowell3@yahoo.co.uk&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Yours sincerely,<BR>
<BR>
