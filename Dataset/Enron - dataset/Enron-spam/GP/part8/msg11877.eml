Attn:Request For Assistance.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; You may be surprise to receive this letter from me, since you =
don't know me personally, I am DEMPAT<BR>
WEMBA the first son of MOYO WEMBA who was recently murdered in a land =
dispute in Zimbabwe.<BR>
&nbsp; I am writing this letter to request your assistance and =
confidentiality to handle a transfer of fund into a<BR>
Foreign account and I decided to write you,my late father was among the =
few black Zimbabwean rich<BR>
farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling Government of =
President Robert Mugabe, for<BR>
his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party =
controlled by the white minority.<BR>
&nbsp; Before my fathers death, he has taken his fund to Europe and =
deposited the sum of Thirty six Million<BR>
United State Dollars ($36million)with a Security and Finance Company as =
if he foreseen the looming<BR>
danger in Zimbabwe. This money was allocated for the purchase of new =
Machinery and chemical<BR>
products for Agro allied farm and for the establishment of new farms in =
Lesotho and Swaziland.<BR>
&nbsp; These land problems arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced =
a new land act that wholly<BR>
affected the rich white farmers, and the blacks vehemently condemned the =
&quot;modsoperandi&quot; adopted by<BR>
the government. This resulted to rampant Killings and mob action by the =
war veterans and some political<BR>
thugs,precisely more than three thousands(3,000)people have so far been =
killed.Heads of government<BR>
from the west, especially Britain and United States have voiced their =
condemnation of Mugabe's plans.<BR>
Subsequently, South Africa Development Community (S.A.D.C) has =
continuously supported Mugabe's<BR>
new land act, it is against this background that my entire family who =
are currently residing in South Africa<BR>
have decided to transfer my father's money into a foreign account.<BR>
&nbsp; As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the =
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account<BR>
where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my =
government who are tactically<BR>
freezing our family's wealth and South Africa government seem to be =
playing along with them. I am faced<BR>
with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for the fear of =
encountering the same experience<BR>
in the future,since both countries have the same political history.<BR>
&nbsp; More so, The South Africa Foreign Exchange policy does not allow =
such investment, Hence I am<BR>
seeking for political asylum in The Netherlands. As a business person, I =
wannts to entrust my future and<BR>
that of my family into your hands, I must let you know that this =
transaction is 100% risk free and the nature<BR>
of your business does not necessarily matter.<BR>
&nbsp; For your assistance,we are offering you 15% of the sum, 80% for =
me and my family, while 5% will be<BR>
mapped out for any expenses that we may incurred during this =
transaction.We wish to invest our money<BR>
on commercial properties based on your advice.Finally,i will demand for =
a total assurance and sincerity on<BR>
your part when the fund gets to the account you are going to provide in =
your country.If this proposal is<BR>
accepted by you, please confirm by you sending me an email with this =
email address<BR>
(dwemba@hotmail.com ).<BR>
&nbsp;Thanks&nbsp; and God bless you. Awaiting your urgent response.<BR>
&nbsp; Kind&nbsp; Regards ,<BR>
