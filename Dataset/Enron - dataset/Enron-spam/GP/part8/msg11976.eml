<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;From Mrs. Susan.<BR>
Johannesburg,South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
Greetings to you,<BR>
<BR>
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,and I hope this =
mail<BR>
meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact =
might<BR>
seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the =
past,<BR>
I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its mportance and =
the<BR>
immense benefit it will be to you.<BR>
<BR>
After careful consideration with my children, we resolved to contact =
you<BR>
for your most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize for<BR>
infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as =
I<BR>
make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.<BR>
<BR>
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name =
is<BR>
Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother of two and the Deputy Minister of Minerals =
and<BR>
Energy, Republic of South Africa from April 1996 - April 2004 and =
now<BR>
Deputy Minister of Safety and Security of the Republic of South =
Africa.<BR>
You can go through my profile<BR>
<BR>
:<A =
HREF=3D"http://www.info.gov.za/leaders/depmin/safesec.htm">http://www.inf=
o.gov.za/leaders/depmin/safesec.htm</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I will now give you a general overview of the situation. When I was =
sworn<BR>
in as Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy in 1996, with my =
influence,<BR>
my husband Mr.Ndelebe Shabangu, a very successful businessman was =
awarded<BR>
several contracts in my ministry and had direct dealings with =
foreign<BR>
investors in this field. Due to my political status, I was not involved =
in<BR>
my husband's business, which was very vast and successful.<BR>
<BR>
My beloved husband died whilst on an official trip to Trinidad and =
Tobago<BR>
in February 2001.When my husband died, I was contacted as Next of Kin by =
a<BR>
private security firm in Nigeria to come forth with the Certificate =
of<BR>
Deposit and claim a safety deposit my husband has in their Vault in =
his<BR>
name. At that time, my children and I did not have an idea where the<BR>
Certificate might be. We then instructed the security firm to =
continue<BR>
holding the safety deposit until further instructions from me. =
Whilst<BR>
preparing for the second remembrance of my beloved husband, I was =
going<BR>
through his library collection and to my astonishment I discovered =
a,<BR>
Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit with this private =
security<BR>
firm, and other documents relating to the safety deposit in a file.<BR>
<BR>
The safety deposit according to the documents is available in a trunk =
and<BR>
is stocked with hard currency (US Dollars)$18,500,000, which was =
generated<BR>
from cash payments from his business associates in the diamond =
trade.<BR>
Though, I knew my late husband was in the Oil contracts and diamond<BR>
business, but did not have the knowledge that he moved funds in cash =
to<BR>
Nigeria. This has came as a shock to me and my children, and we have<BR>
decided to have this fund invested immediately in commercial and<BR>
residential properties abroad as well as in any profitable ventures, =
since<BR>
no member of my family can hold such huge amount in our name due to =
my<BR>
political status and to avoid any Government investigations, hence =
we<BR>
sincerely appeal to you to render us your most needed assistance in =
this<BR>
regard. If you agree to render us your assistance, your role in this<BR>
project will be to act on my behalf as a trustee to receive the =
safety<BR>
deposit containing the funds from the Security firm.<BR>
<BR>
Though, I believe this transaction should be based on mutuality, a =
family<BR>
associate, who is a diplomat, will protect my family's interest. He is =
now<BR>
aware of the safety deposit, and I have informed him that I am =
locating<BR>
one of my husband's business associates (YOU) to handle the funds =
and<BR>
invest on our behalf, as he might be opposed to our decision if he =
found<BR>
out that I barely know you. The part of services the diplomat is =
required<BR>
to render is to assist you in claiming the consignments from the =
terminal<BR>
of the security company and to set up a transit domiciliary account =
in<BR>
your name in one of the prime bank he has contacts to carry out the<BR>
exercise through the back door.<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of the account is to enable you deposit the funds for =
further<BR>
transfer into your nominated bank. For your reliable assistance, we =
are<BR>
offering you 25% ($4,625,000) of the funds. I wish to thank you in =
advance<BR>
as we anticipate your assistance in enabling us achieve this goal. =
On<BR>
hearing from you, I will forward your contact of the diplomat who will =
be<BR>
representing us in Nigeria, and also give you his contact for both of =
you<BR>
to communicate and proceed with the transaction. He will be working =
with<BR>
you for a mutual conclusion of the process and I look forward to a =
long<BR>
lasting business relationship with you. As you may understand, due to =
my<BR>
sensitive position in the present government, it is not safe to<BR>
communicate with me via phone or fax for now.<BR>
<BR>
With warm regards,<BR>
<BR>
MRS. SUSAN SHABANGU<BR>
Deputy Minister of Safety and Security, South Africa<BR>
