A|berta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most highly =
coveted<BR>

<BR>
Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and =
Gas<BR>
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)<BR>
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|l awaiting =
a<BR>
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have<BR>
been waiting for a rig to become avai|ab|e for over two weeks, and<BR>
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.<BR>
<BR>
The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake prOject.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Symbo| - MOGI<BR>
Price - .43<BR>
<BR>
Reasons to conside MOGI:<BR>
<BR>
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest =
bull<BR>
market in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.<BR>
<BR>
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production =
on<BR>
reserves potential|y worth mu|ti-millions, MOGI is se|ling for |ess<BR>
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.<BR>
<BR>
4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn<BR>
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. =
Already<BR>
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overal|<BR>
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry =
sectors<BR>
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized<BR>
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (MOgi) that the biggest =
gains<BR>
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made =
triple<BR>
and even quadrup|e returns.<BR>
