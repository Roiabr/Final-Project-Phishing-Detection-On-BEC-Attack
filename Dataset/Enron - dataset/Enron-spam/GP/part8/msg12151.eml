<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Sir,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT size=3D5>Details</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>During the regime of President Charles Taylor in Liberia, I was the =
special adviser to the President on Minerals and Allied matters. Also, I =
was made the chairman of the <FONT size=3D4>Presidential Task Force on =
Sales and Exportation of Diamonds and other Gem Stones</FONT>, which are =
the major mineral deposits in Liberia.</DIV>
<DIV>The above positions availed me the opportunity to divert some fund, =
which was deposited with a private security vault firm in <FONT =
size=3D4>EUROPE</FONT>. This I did due to the instability in Liberia =
during the regime of Charles Taylor, in order to safeguard my future and =
the future of my entire family. </DIV>
<DIV>You may be aware of the protracted war in Liberia. The political =
uncertainty is very unfriendly. The government of Charles Taylor, under =
which I served, had been discredited by the western world, especially =
the United States who forcefully removed the President and his cabinet =
and sent them to exile. This is the reason why I am in asylum in the =
Nigeria being a top member of Charles Taylor=E2?Ts cabinet.</DIV>
<DIV>Thank God, the intention for which I diverted the fund was =
instantly justified at the inception of a new transition government. All =
the members of the former regime, including me, were put under probe. =
Our assets were confiscated. All traceable bank accounts, both in =
Liberia and overseas, were frozen, pending the findings of the probe =
committee or probable pardon by the new regime. </DIV>
<DIV>My only fund that could not be traced is the fund I diverted to the =
private security vault company in Netherlands. The deposit was made in =
the form of <FONT size=3D4>=E2?=9CConcealed Lodgment</FONT>=E2?=9D and =
the deposit Manifest was made as <FONT size=3D4>Diamonds and Family =
treasures</FONT>. The only person that is aware of this deposit is my =
personal lawyer, who I can trust, and you, who I have just told in =
utmost confidence. Please, let it be so and may God help us.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The amount in question is <FONT size=3D4>USD$15 Million (Fifteen =
Million Dollars</FONT>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>This is the fund I want to invest, through an honest and trusted =
ally, in any good business in&nbsp; any country outside the continent of =
Africa. This necessitated my search for a competent and reliable person =
who will oversee the investment on the basis of a joint venture =
partnership for our mutual benefit. My initial idea was to invest this =
fund in real estate. But your choice of any other business =
either&nbsp;in your country in any&nbsp; other country other than Africa =
will be appreciated.</DIV>
<DIV>The details of the partnership terms will be drafted by my lawyer =
on confirmation of your willingness to assist in this venture. Also, a =
meeting could be arranged between you and my lawyer who is based here. =
This will enable us sign a Memorandum Of Understanding before the fund =
will be transferred from the security vault company to your =
custody.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I look forward to your prompt response as I wish to move this fund =
out of the vault company due to high cost of deposit contract =
renewal.</DIV>
<DIV>Regards.</DIV>
