In England nobody under the age of 18 is allowed to drink in a =
public<BR>
bar.Mr. Thompson used to go to a bar near his house quite often, but =
he<BR>
never took his son, Tom, because he was too young. Then when Tom had =
his<BR>
eighteenth birthday, Mr. Thompson took him to his usual bar for the =
first<BR>
time. They drank for half an hour, and then Mr. Thompson said to his =
son,<BR>
&quot;Now, Tom, I want to teach you a useful lesson. You must always be =
careful<BR>
not to drink too much. And how you know when you've had enough? Well, =
I'll<BR>
tell you. Do you see those two lights at the end of the bar? When they =
seem<BR>
to have become four, you've had enough and should go =
home.&quot;&quot;But , Dad,&quot; said<BR>
Tom, &quot; I can only see one light at the end of the bar&quot;.<BR>
A woman has twins, and gives them up for adoption. One of them goes to =

family in Spain;<BR>
they name him &quot;Juan.&quot;Years later, Juan sends a picture of =
himself to his<BR>
mom. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her husband that she wishes =
she<BR>
also had a picture of Amal. Her husband responds, &quot;But they are =
twins--if<BR>
you've seen Juan, you've seen Amal.&quot;<BR>
