Little Johnny came home early from school and started calling his =
mother<BR>
with no answer. He finally went up stairs and saw the bedroom door was =
open<BR>
a little. When he peered in, he saw his dad on the bed with the maid so =
he<BR>
quietly went outside and waited for his mother. When she showed up with =
some<BR>
groceries, he said &quot;Mommy, Mommy guess what I saw? I saw daddy =
upstairs on<BR>
the bed with the maid and they were.......&quot; and his Mother said, =
&quot;Stop right<BR>
there, Johnny&quot;. Wait until supper tonight when the maid is serving =
the meal.<BR>
When I wink at you, then tell me the story.&quot; At supper when all =
were seated<BR>
and being served by the maid, she winked and Johnny began again. =
&quot;Mommy,<BR>
When I got home from school early today, I was looking for you and saw =
daddy<BR>
on the bed with the maid. They were doing the same thing that I saw you =
and<BR>
Uncle Phil doing at the cottage last summer.&quot;<BR>
A young man saw an elderly couple sitting down to lunch at McDonald's. =
He<BR>
noticed that they had ordered one meal, and an extra drink cup. As =
he<BR>
watched, the older gentleman carefully divided the hamburger in half, =
then<BR>
counted out the fries, one for him, one for her, until each had half =
of<BR>
them. Then the old man poured half of the soft drink into the extra cup =
and<BR>
set that in front of his wife. The old man then began to eat, and his =
wife<BR>
sat watching, with her hands folded in her lap. The young man decided to =
ask<BR>
if they would allow him to purchase another meal for them so that =
they<BR>
didn't have to split theirs. The old gentleman said, &quot;Oh, no. We've =
been<BR>
married 50 years, and everything has always been and will always be =
shared,<BR>
50/50.&quot; The young man then asked the wife if she was going to eat, =
and she<BR>
replied, &quot;Not yet. It's his turn with the teeth.<BR>
