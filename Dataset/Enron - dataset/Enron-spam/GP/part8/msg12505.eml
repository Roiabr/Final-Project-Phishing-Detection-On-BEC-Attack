<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>increase the size of your manhood<BR>
<BR>
90% of males were interested in improving their sexual stamina,<BR>
performance, and the size of their manhood. Are you one of the 90%?<BR>
<BR>
You guys have made my dreams come true. I have been self-conscience for =
as<BR>
long as I can remember. I did not want to shower with other guys growing =
up,<BR>
because I was embarrassed. Not only has your system increased the size =
of my<BR>
manhood while erect, but it has helped my size while flaccid as well. I =
hang<BR>
bigger, and I feel more like the man I should have been all these years. =
The<BR>
change is tremendous, I wanted to send you this note to let you know =
what it<BR>
has done for me, and of course to order more LONGZ! Leroy, Brooklyn<BR>

But suppose, said Rob, that something important should happen while =
I'm<BR>
asleep, or not looking at the box? I have called this a Record, replied =
the<BR>
Demon, and such it really is, although I have shown you only such events =
as<BR>
are in process of being recorded. By pressing this spring you may open =
the<BR>
opposite cover of the box, where all events of importance that have =
occurred<BR>
throughout the world during the previous twenty-four hours will =
appear<BR>
before you in succession<BR>
You may thus study them at your leisure<BR>
