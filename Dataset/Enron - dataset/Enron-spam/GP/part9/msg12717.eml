Bank Of The North,<BR>
Victoria Island Branch,<BR>
Lagos, Nigeria.<BR>
<BR>
My Dear Friend,<BR>
I am Dr.Nkem George, Branch Manager with Bank of<BR>
the North, Victoria Island Branch, Lagos,&nbsp; Nigeria.<BR>
I have an urgent and very profitable business<BR>
proposition for you that should be handled with<BR>
extreme confidentiality.<BR>
On January 6,1999 a Foreign Oil Consultant and<BR>
contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum<BR>
Corporation (NNPC) Mr. James Herbert by name made a<BR>
numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months<BR>
valued at US$38.6M (Thirty Eight Million, Six Hundred<BR>
United States Dollars Only) in my branch.<BR>
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification in<BR>
accordance with the Bank policy to his forwarding<BR>
address but got no reply.<BR>
After a month we sent a reminder and finally we<BR>
discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian<BR>
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) that Mr. James<BR>
Herbert died from an automobile accident.<BR>
On further investigation, we found out that he died<BR>
without making a Will and all attempts to trace his<BR>
next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further<BR>
investigations and discovered that Mr. James Herbert<BR>
did not declare any next of kin or relations in all<BR>
his official documents including his Bank Deposit<BR>
paperwork in my Bank.<BR>
This sum of US$38.6M has been carefully&nbsp; moved out of<BR>
my bank to a Security Company in Europe for<BR>
safekeeping.<BR>
No one will ever come forward to claim it and<BR>
according to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 and<BR>
half years the money will revert to the ownership of the<BR>
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the<BR>
fund.<BR>
This prompted us to contact you.We will like to front<BR>
you as the next of kin of our late client thereby<BR>
making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $38.6<BR>
million U.S Dollars that is presently in a Security<BR>
Company in Europe.<BR>
I contacted you because it is against our code of<BR>
ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your<BR>
assistance would be needed to claim the money in the<BR>
Security Company in Europe.<BR>
We have unanimously agreed that 25% of the entire sum<BR>
would be for you if you agree to take part in this<BR>
profitable transaction,70% for me and 2 of my<BR>
colleagues while the remaining 5% would be used to pay<BR>
back the expenses that may be incurred during the<BR>
course of the transaction by both parties after the<BR>
fund has been claimed and lodged in your account.<BR>
In the event that you are genuinely interested in the<BR>
transaction,the following information would be needed<BR>
from you to expedite action.<BR>
1) Your Full Name and Address that would be used to<BR>
establish you as the next of kin of our late client<BR>
thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the fund.<BR>
This would ensure that the Security Company in Europe<BR>
releases the Consignment/Fund to you.<BR>
2) Your Private Mobile,Telphone and Fax numbers where<BR>
you can be reached at all time because this<BR>
transaction entails constant communication.<BR>
The transaction is 100% risk free as all modalities<BR>
has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of<BR>
the transaction.<BR>
If you are interested, send the requested information<BR>
via email<BR>
<BR>
I await your response urgently.<BR>
Regards,<BR>
Dr. Nkem George<BR>
