LETH is thriving as an emerging world leader in the conversion of =
waste<BR>
materials into electrical energy by utilizing their Biosphere Process =
System,<BR>
making them the hottest undervalued stock at this price level where =
shares<BR>
are ready to explode on huge investor attention.<BR>
<BR>
Sales have rocketed beyond all estimates for LETH with no signs of<BR>
slowing. The numbers continue to stack-up as sales orders for the =
Biosphere<BR>
exceed $150 Million over the past year while the stock price doesn't =
yet<BR>

balance<BR>

under<BR>
accumulation, but we are acting aggressively on this recently filed =
data.<BR>
<BR>
The unique proprietary technology of the Biosphere fills an urgent<BR>
worldwide need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a<BR>
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal =
of<BR>
waste. The Biosphere System provides the highest level of innovative<BR>
technology while securing worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary =
product<BR>
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while<BR>
simultaneously generating electricity.<BR>
<BR>
The Biosphere System enables LETH to draw revenue from the disposal =

various types of waste at 5 to 7 tons per hour including such materials =
as:<BR>
Municipal Solid Waste, refinery wastes, agricultural surpluses or =
effluents,<BR>
medical waste, industrial waste, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the =

electricity<BR>
which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.<BR>

Department<BR>
of Environmental Quality permitting for the Biosphere Process in the =
state of<BR>
Louisiana. This is a monumental event for LETH which opens the<BR>
floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a =
parallel<BR>
effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement.<BR>
<BR>
LETH has begun to catch the profit-making attention of investors by<BR>
embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem while a major =
push<BR>
for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the =
hot<BR>
topic due to shortages and massive power failures. LETH contains all =
the<BR>
ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis =
areas,<BR>
waste and electrical energy, reaches unprecedented levels. We view =
this<BR>
perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional =
contracts<BR>
that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's own sales records. =
We<BR>
are seeing substantial gains for early investors in a ground floor =
