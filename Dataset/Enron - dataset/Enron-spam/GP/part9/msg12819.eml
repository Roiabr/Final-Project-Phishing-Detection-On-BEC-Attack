&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&gt;Attention:<BR>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to get in contact with you for a business =
proposal.<BR>
My name is James Braithwaite, a farmer in HARARE (ZIMBABAWE). I got =
to<BR>
know of you from the annual report of the Chambers of Commerce and =
Industry. And from indications, you are broad in business managements, =
for which I need your assistance to some investments and guide me into =
the business world.<BR>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the present repression by President Robert Mugabe =
on white<BR>
farmers in Zimbabwe, I decided to sell my farms and go into other =
investments and businesses in Europe or any part of the World. I would =
like to let you know that I have been able to realize the sum of =
US$10.000.000 (Ten million United States Dollars) from the sales of my =
farms, which I would like you to help me put into investments. I have my =
lawyer Mr. Glen Bates in Europe at the moment, who can meet with you on =
my behalf to formalize arrangements for the money to be transfered to =
where-ever you decides, if you accept my proposal and we come to an =
agreement as partners. You should reply to my e-mail, =
braithwaite@whipmail.com And my lawyer will get in contact with you for =
details. This issue is very personal and confidential.<BR>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, you should know that I have a good percentage =
offer of the total money for you at the conclusion of the transaction, =
and 5% of<BR>
the total money is set aside for expenses during the process. Your<BR>
&gt;recommendations and opinion is welcomed.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expecting to hear from you,<BR>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Braithwaite<BR>
