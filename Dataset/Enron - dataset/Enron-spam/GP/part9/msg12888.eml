<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
My name is Mr Daniel Kobena, 41 years Ghanaian<BR>
married with Five Children. I work as an<BR>
administrative Secretary/Attorney with GLOBAL<BR>
SECURITY COMPANY (Ltd) Accra Ghana. I joined the<BR>
services of this company in 1991.<BR>
<BR>
I got the information concerning you and your company<BR>
from our Chamber of Commerce here and after due<BR>
consultation, I decided to contact you believing that<BR>
by the grace of God that you will be my<BR>
partner in this business. I have worked with this<BR>
company for over 13 years, within this period of time<BR>
I watched with meticulous precision on<BR>
how African Head of State and government functionaries<BR>
have been moving huge sums of money (Dollars, Pound<BR>
Sterling, French Franc, Cash)with the aid of their<BR>
foreign partners abroad.<BR>
<BR>
They bring in these consignment of money cash and<BR>
secretly declare the content as jewelries, Gold,<BR>
Precious Stones, Family Treasure, Documents,etc.<BR>
Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Fodey Sankoy of Sierra<BR>
Leone, FelixHouphet Buigny of Ivory Coast, Konnan Bede<BR>
of Ivory Coast, etc.<BR>
<BR>
These people have at one time or the other<BR>
depositedconsignments withus and their foreign<BR>
partners, relatives and Next of Kin are Claiming most<BR>
of these consignment and a lot more are laying here<BR>
unclaimed for as much as 7 years, as no available<BR>
information to anybody except the depositors, and most<BR>
of them are dead. Since the inception of the year<BR>
2003, GLOBAL SECURITY COMPANY LTD Management changed<BR>
the procedure of claiming of consignments.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as you are able to produce all the secret<BR>
information as contained in the secret file of the<BR>
company as regard the consignment, it will be released<BR>
to you upon demand. From our records, more<BR>
than 10 consignments belonging to these people has<BR>
been claimed in the past six months and this is why I<BR>
am seeking for your co-operation and assistance.<BR>
<BR>
Mr.Christopher Cambell is a Zimbabwean, and he work with<BR>
one of the top ministers of President Robert Mugabe<BR>
who was in charge of the campaigning for re-electing<BR>
Mr. Mugabe into office in their last election. He<BR>
deposited this consignment in 1999 after absconding<BR>
with the money 35.5 million United State Dollars<BR>
($35.5m USD).<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, Mr.Christopher Cambell died in Kenyan<BR>
aircraft that killed all on board in 2000.<BR>
<BR>
Since his death, no one knows about this transaction<BR>
with Global Security Company Ltd except me who acted<BR>
as company attorney when he deposited the consignment.<BR>
I have finished every arrangement for you to come and<BR>
claim the consignment as the next of Kin to Mr.<BR>
Christopher Cambell.<BR>
<BR>
The procedure is very simple: - Apply officially to<BR>
the Director of operation Global security company pty<BR>
Accra - Ghana, for the release of consignment<BR>
No.GSS/15031964.<BR>
<BR>
They will demand for some documents and the security<BR>
code of the consignment, you will call on me to supply<BR>
you with every detailed Information as regard the<BR>
consignment.<BR>
As soon as they have confirmed it to be correct, the<BR>
company will invite you for the collection.<BR>
<BR>
Nobody will ever know that I am involved in the deal<BR>
, I suggest upon conclusion, we share it on the Ratio<BR>
of 50%-40%and 10% will go for humanitarian service ie<BR>
motherless babies home, more also you will make an<BR>
arrangement on investments that I will invest my money<BR>
in your country.<BR>
<BR>
I assure you that this business is very secure and<BR>
risk free.<BR>
<BR>
Please, if you are not interested on this proposal,<BR>
kindly let me know.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>
<BR>
