BREAKING NEWS - CYPM Acquires Profitable Joongang Movie =
Entertainment...CYPM To Compete With Pixar &amp; Disney<BR>
<BR>
NEW YORK---PRIMEZONE---Cyper Media, Inc. (CYPM), a 3D animation studio =
currently producing ``The 5th Glacial Epoch,'' a 15 million dollar =
feature, has acquired Joongang Movie Entertainment Co., Ltd., a producer =
of animated content for the world-famous Pokemon series. Joongang is a =
profitable 13-year-old animation company with more than 60 different =
clients among OEM Japanese TV shows, and which also has numerous clients =
in Europe.<BR>
<BR>
Duk Jin Jang, CEO of Cyper said, ``Cyper will now be able to offer our =
combined clients traditional 2D along with 3D animation content, =
enabling the Company to compete profitably with world class animators =
such as Pixar and Disney.''<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
STOCK PROFILE OF THE WEEK<BR>
<BR>
We are very excited about our newest stock profile, Cyper Media, Inc. =
(CYPM).&nbsp; Not only has CYPM received a conditional commitment letter =
for 4 million of the 15 million dollar production budget for its CGI =
Animation Feature, &quot;The 5th Glacial Epoch,&quot; it has also =
entered into a commitment for a 5 million dollar advance from an =
electronic game publisher. The money for its latest venture seems to be =
pouring in, but mere financing is just the beginning.<BR>
<BR>
The really big news is that CYPM has started the process of getting a =
distribution contract with MGM, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.&nbsp; The 4 million =
dollar commitment letter from Global Marine is subject to a letter of a =
conditional Distribution Letter from a major distributor, which CYPM has =
now secured.<BR>
<BR>
Cyper Media&nbsp; is looking to become a leading producer of 3D digital =
animation entertainment products for the world broadcast entertainment =
market.<BR>
<BR>
Cyper Media develops and produces 3D digital animation for television, =
short films, CGI feature films, home video, music video and multi-media =
applications such as video games. Cyper Media produces 3D digital =
animation by applying advanced hardware and software technology using =
computer systems throughout the production process.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
LICENSING &amp; MERCHANDISING RIGHTS<BR>
<BR>
The Company intends to exploit the licensing and merchandising of its =
proprietary characters in order to generate revenue and to highten the =
popularity of its characters and programs. By licensing its proprietary =
characters to select manufacturers and distributors of consumer products =
such as toys, apparel, school supplies, house wares and books, the =
Company seeks to capture a portion of the growing licensing and =
merchandising market which features entertainment properties, such as =
animated characters.&nbsp; In 1995, this segment of the merchandising =
and licensing market had retail sales in the United States and Canada in =
excess of 16 billion dollars.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
OUTLINING THE THE OPPORTUNITIES<BR>
<BR>
The demand for animation programming and the business of animation =
production have expanded dramatically over the past decade. The revival =
of Disney's feature animation production in the 1990s, and the advent of =
new entrants like Paramount and DreamWorks SKG, have produced some of =
the biggest ever box office hits.<BR>
<BR>
The television market has also expanded, offering producers a voracious =
and lucrative market. Thanks to programs like The Simpsons and South =
Park, animation has started to become a staple element of prime-time =
television programming.&nbsp; Animation is an attractive investment =
because of its longevity, its ability to travel, and the potential to =
create ancillary revenue streams from home video, publishing, toys and =
other licensing activities.<BR>
<BR>
As well, the Academy Awards now recognizes Animation in a major category =
all its own.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT<BR>
<BR>
Typically a US made 22-minute television show costs between 300,000 to =
800,000 dollars to produce.&nbsp; Cyper can produce the same for a =
minimum of 80,000.&nbsp; This means many U.S.-based producers of =
animated programming such as Film Roman now have to subcontract some of =
the less creative and more labor-intensive components of its production =
process to animation studios located in low-cost labor countries, such =
as Korea. As the number of animated feature films and animated =
television programs expands, the demand for the services of overseas =
studios has expanded likewise. This demand may lead overseas studios to =
raise their fees, which may result in a rise in production costs, or an =
inability to contract with the Company's preferred overseas studios.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN THIS INDUSTRY?<BR>
<BR>
The list of Top Ten grossing animated movies is impressive.&nbsp; The =
Lion King is at number one with a total gross of 312.8 million =
dollars.&nbsp; Shrek brings up second place with a whopping 267.6 =
million, and Monsters, Inc. takes third with 255.3 million.&nbsp; The =
other seven rounding out the list post an impressive Billion-plus.<BR>
<BR>
But the most recent animated feature that comes to mind is playing in =
theaters now.&nbsp; &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; sold about 70.6 million =
worth of tickets in its first three days, setting a new opening record =
for a cartoon, surpassing the 62.5 million bow of &quot;Monsters, =
Inc.&quot; in November 2001. And although Nemo is a Walt Disney =
production, Disney no longer has a monopoly on animated features.&nbsp; =
In fact, of the Top 10 grossing animated features of all time, 4 are =
Walt Disney productions while Pixar, a newcomer in comparison, also has =
4, with Fox and DreamWorks rounding out the list.<BR>
<BR>
But earnings for such movies don't stop at the box office.&nbsp; Just =
the opposite--they are only beginning.&nbsp; Merchandising from these =
movies, everything from lunch boxes to video games to DVD sales, from =
Wal-mart to McDonald's to Burger King, range in the billions of =
dollars--and never forget about the impending sequels.&nbsp; Sales are =
huge, and CYPM through Cyper (now with financing on the way and MGM on =
their side) is poised to make the climb to the top.&nbsp; It's only a =
matter of time.<BR>
<BR>
