<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>DEAR FRIEND ,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Please don't be surprised to receive this letter from me since we =
do<BR>
&nbsp;not know each other before now. I am MRS. JULIANA MBULUKU MAKELE, =
the<BR>
&nbsp;wife of late TATE MAKELE , a farmer in ZIMBABWE who was<BR>
&nbsp;murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact =
through<BR>
&nbsp;network online hence decided to write you.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;Before the death of my husband, he made a deposit with a security =
Firm.<BR>
&nbsp;The consignment was declared to contain GEM STONES shipped on<BR>
diplomatic<BR>
&nbsp;cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents. The =
actual<BR>
&nbsp;content is the sum of US25.5 million (TWENTY Five Million, =
Five<BR>
Hundred<BR>
&nbsp;thousand United States dollars only). This was done when he =
noticed<BR>
the<BR>
&nbsp;looming danger in Zimbabwe on land policies.The security company =
does<BR>
&nbsp;not know<BR>
&nbsp;the actual contents of the two-box out of the ten trunk boxes/<BR>
&nbsp;consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security =
reasons.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;This mount was meant for the purchase of new Agricultural =
machineries<BR>
&nbsp;and<BR>
&nbsp;chemicals for our Farms and establishment of new farms in =
Swaziland.<BR>
&nbsp;This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert =
Mugabe<BR>
&nbsp;introduced a new Land Act Reform that wholly affected the rich =
white<BR>
&nbsp;farmers and some few black farmers alike. This resulted to the =
killing<BR>
&nbsp;and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in =
the<BR>
&nbsp;society during political elections in my country. In fact a lot =
of<BR>
&nbsp;people<BR>
&nbsp;were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my husband =
was<BR>
one<BR>
&nbsp;of<BR>
&nbsp;the victims.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;It is against this background that, all my family members fled<BR>
Zimbabwe<BR>
&gt; for fear of our<BR>
&nbsp;lives. We are currently taking refuge in the Ghana where we =
sort<BR>
&nbsp;political asylum. At this point, we decided to transfer my =
late<BR>
husband's<BR>
&nbsp;money to a more<BR>
&nbsp;reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because =
the<BR>
&nbsp;money is not being used,<BR>
&nbsp;lying in the security company.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I must let you know that this transaction is<BR>
&nbsp;free from risk because I have all the necessary documents.<BR>
&nbsp;If you accept to assist us, do please contact our<BR>
&nbsp;Lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to<BR>
&nbsp;be done to finalize all the arrangements with<BR>
&nbsp;the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you =
after<BR>
&nbsp;reaching a workable agreement with you.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;BARRISTER HOPE &amp; Martins LAW CHAMBERS,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;E-mail: hope_martinslegal@simbamail.fm&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;He would conclude all arrangements with you to clear<BR>
&nbsp;the consignment[in which the funds are secretly packed ) already =
in<BR>
the<BR>
&nbsp;custody of the Diplomatic Firm.<BR>
&nbsp;He would also enlighten you on the sharing (70%/30% basis) and =
the<BR>
&nbsp;subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share =
with<BR>
&nbsp;your advice<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; THIS MATTER REQUIRE MATURITY AND TRUST.<BR>
<BR>
