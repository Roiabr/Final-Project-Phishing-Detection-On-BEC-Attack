for the fault within himself. Failure to hit the bull's eye is never the =
fault of the target. To improve your aim -- improve yourself.<BR>

On the summit see, The seals of office glitter in his eyes; He climbs, =
he pants, he grasps them! At his heels, Close at his heels, a demagogue =
ascends, And with a dexterous jerk soon twists him down, And wins them, =
but to lose them in his turn.<BR>
