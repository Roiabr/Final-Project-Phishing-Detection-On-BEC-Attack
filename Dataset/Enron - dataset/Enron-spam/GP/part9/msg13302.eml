Dear Sir/Madam,<BR>
<BR>
First of all let me introduce myself to you.My name are Mr.Safi <BR>
Lopi,a consulting auditor of prime banks here in South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
Without wasting much time,let me go straight to the point.On June <BR>
6,1998,there was an American Mining onsultant/contractor with the <BR>
South African Mining corporation, Mr.Gregory A.Williams who made a <BR>
numbered time (fixed)deposit with my bank here for twelve calendar <BR>
months,value US $14,200,000.00 an account. On maturity, The bank sent =
<BR>
a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply <BR>
 from him. <BR>
<BR>
After a month,The bank sent another reminder and finally his contract =
<BR>
employers,the South African Mining corporation wrote to inform the <BR>
bank that Mr.Gregory A.Williams died from an automobile accident,that =
<BR>
he died without MAKING A WILL attached to the account, and all <BR>
attempts by the American Embassy to trace his next of kin was <BR>
fruitless. <BR>
<BR>
I therefore, made further investigation and discovered that <BR>
Mr.Gregory A.Williams in fact was an immigrant from Jamaica and only =
<BR>
recently obtained American citizenship.He did not declare any kin or =
<BR>
relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit <BR>
paper work. This money total U S $ 14,200,000.00 is still sitting in =
<BR>
my bank as dormant Account. <BR>
<BR>
No one will ever come forward to claim it, and according to South <BR>
African banking policy,after 5years, the money will revert to the <BR>
ownership of the South African Government if the account owner is <BR>
certified dead. This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am <BR>
looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to <BR>
Mr.Gregory A.Williams,and a Bank Account abroad will then facilitate =
<BR>
the transfer of this money to the beneficiary/ next of kin.<BR>
<BR>
This is simple, all you have to do is to immediately send me a bank <BR>
old account &nbsp;or you set up a new account anywhere in the world for =
me <BR>
to arrange the proper money transfer paperwork. This money total USD =
<BR>
($14.2M) will then be paid into this Account for us to share in the <BR>
ratio of 60% for me, 35 % for you and 5% for expenses that might come =
<BR>
up during transfer process. There is no risk at all, and all the <BR>
paper work for this transaction will be done by me using my position =
<BR>
and connection in the banks in South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
Please observe the utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this =
<BR>
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall <BR>
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.<BR>
<BR>
I look forward to your earliest reply through &nbsp;my email address. =
<BR>
Thanks and god bless you and your family and bless me too.<BR>
<BR>
Have a nice day. &nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Yours truly.<BR>
<BR>
Mr.Safi Lopi.<BR>
