<p align=3D"center"><FONT style=3D"FONT-SIZE: 1px">Gov. Sonny Perdue's =
child endangerment bill breezed through the state House of =
Representatives on Friday, clearing the way for him to sign it into law. =
Gov. Sonny Perdue says the child endangerment bill, which he plans to =
sign soon, "puts people on notice that children are a precious resource =
that must be protected."The House voted 161-1 in favor of the =
legislation. The one vote against the measure was cast by Rep. Bobby =
Franklin (R-Marietta).The law would allow prosecutors to hold parents =
and caregivers criminally accountable for reckless and negligent =
behavior that endangers a child. It also would create a separate felony =
for making the illegal drug methamphetamine in the presence of a =
child.Perdue said the methamphetamine provision was critical. He cited =
the deaths of three young children Thursday in a fire that police =
suspect was started at an illegal methamphetamine lab in Griffin.The =
legislation resulted from a rare collaboration between Perdue, a =
Republican, and Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor, a Democrat. It adds criminal =
negligence, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison, to the =
state's child cruelty statute. Parents caught making methamphetamine in =
the presence of children could be sent to prison for two to 15 years. A =
sentence of up to 20 years could be imposed in cases where a child =
suffers serious injury.Perdue said the bill, which he plans to sign =
soon, "puts people on notice that children are a precious resource that =
must be protected."Taylor had pushed for a child endangerment law for =
four years, struggling to convince lawmakers that it would not become a =
tool for overzealous prosecutors."This legislation does not punish =
accidents," the lieutenant governor said. The law was created to punish =
instances of reckless negligence, such as locking a child in a hot car =
in summer, he said. "Parents must always be responsible for the safety =
of their kids. That is the very definition of a parent."The legislation =
is the first sponsored by the governor to pass both houses of the =
General Assembly. Once Perdue signs it, the law will go into effect July =
1.The sole dissenter, Franklin, said he worries that prosecutors might =
use such a law to target parents for having a gun that is not locked =
up.Georgia has been the only state without a law protecting children =
from neglect and recklessness by caregivers or parents who put them in =
harm's way.Politics threatened the bill this session as legislators =
squabbled over who would get credit.Child welfare advocate Wendi =
Clifton, who has fought for the bill for years, predicted that within =
weeks of its being enacted, prosecutions will emerge that could not have =
occurred in the past.The measure will send a strong message to =
caregivers, she said: "You better have a little common sense in =
parenting."Methamphetamine is Georgia's fastest-spreading illegal drug =
problem, and it's taking a mounting toll on children whose parents make =
it. Their lives are threatened by toxic fumes, explosive chemicals and =
fires at the home-based drug labs.In November and December, the =
Journal-Constitution published a series of reports on the dangers of the =
drug to Georgia children. From 1999 through 2003, the number of Georgia =
meth labs raided by police jumped from 29 to 439, according to GBI =
figures based on federal fiscal years.In 2003, police reported 73 =
children living at or exposed to homes used as meth labs in Georgia, =
according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration."Any sign of =
weakness or retreat," Bush said, would only invite further violence.He =
vowed to prevent insurgents from derailing U.S.-led efforts to install a =
democratic government in Iraq. Attacks in Iraq have killed at least 16 =
civilians in recent days."We will never turn over Iraq to terrorists who =
intend our own destruction," Bush said in a White House speech to =
diplomats representing 84 countries. "Whatever it takes, we will fight =
and work to assure the success of freedom in Iraq."Bush made only =
fleeting reference to the alleged Iraqi chemical and biological weapons =
upon which he built his case for war. No stockpiles of such weapons have =
been found.Acknowledging the bitter divisions the war provoked between =
the United States and close allies like France and Germany, both of =
which opposed the invasion, Bush sought to bury the diplomatic hatchet. =
He referred to the two NATO members as "old and valued friends," and =
said, "Those differences belong to the past."Democratic presidential =
candidate John Kerry marked the anniversary by criticizing Bush for =
parting ways with close allies over Iraq, for underestimating the war's =
costs and for his use of pre-war weapons allegations to make the case =
for war.
"Simply put, this president didn't tell the truth about the war," Kerry, =
who was vacationing in Idaho, said in a prepared statement. "Our country =
is paying the price."Kerry has stopped short of calling the war a =
mistake, and he has not called for bringing U.S. forces home from =
Iraq."Saddam was a threat to the United States," said Kerry adviser =
Sandy Berger, who served as national security adviser to President Bill =
Clinton. "Regime change was the right policy, but regime change is not =
the same thing as a unilateral invasion on a hurried timetable."A rash =
of attacks in Iraq killed at least nine civilians Thursday, a day after =
seven were killed when a powerful bomb exploded in Baghdad.Bush, who =
refers to Iraq as the central front in a global anti-terror campaign, =
said the attacks call for "deeper resolve, and bolder action" against =
terrorist networks and their supporters.But law enforcement officials =
say the number of Georgia children affected by meth labs probably is =
higher, because some police departments don't report their data. Phil =
Price, the GBI agent who oversees drug enforcement in North Georgia, =
estimates that children live at or spend time at more than half the =
homes raided for meth labs in his =
region.</font></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
