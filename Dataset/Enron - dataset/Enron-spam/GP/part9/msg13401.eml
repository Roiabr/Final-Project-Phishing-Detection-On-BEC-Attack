Maximum Financial Stock Alert<BR>
<BR>
Life Energy and Technology Holdings<BR>
(OTCBB: LETH)<BR>
Recent Price: 1.90<BR>
52 Week Range: 0.78 - 2.95<BR>
Avg. Volume (100 days): 198,099<BR>
<BR>
LETH, a manufacturer of environmentally friendly<BR>
waste-to-energy conversion systems, has filed the<BR>
required Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing that the<BR>
Company has received $250,000,000 in financing!<BR>
<BR>
This funding package translates into $8.62 per share<BR>
in cash for major worldwide expansion. LETH is firmly<BR>
establishing a major US presence with the installation<BR>
of the Company's Biosphere Process System at the Port<BR>
of New Orleans during this current quarter. The opening<BR>
of this facility will be hailed as a milestone<BR>
achievement complete with intense media coverage and<BR>
the attendance of prominent local and national political<BR>
figures who have paved the way for this ground-<BR>
breaking event.<BR>
<BR>
Key Investment Fact:<BR>
LETH has received sales orders during the past year of<BR>
over $100 million!<BR>
<BR>
Since Jan. 1, 2004 the overall market value<BR>
of our picks has increased by $Millions$!<BR>
<BR>
Here at Maximum Financial, our stock picks<BR>
are up over 348% on average in 2004!<BR>
<BR>
7-Day Target: 3.40<BR>
<BR>
30-Day Target: 5.70<BR>
<BR>
1YR Target: 12.50<BR>
<BR>
Examining LETH - By The Numbers:<BR>
<BR>
Total Assets: 36.8 Million =3D 1.26 per share of assets<BR>
Cash: 23.4 Million =3D .80 cents per share of cash<BR>
Shares Outstanding: 29 million (down from 31.8 million)<BR>
after 2.8 million shares retired in Feb. '04<BR>
Additional Shares to be Retired: 1.3 million per Company<BR>
press release<BR>
Estimated Shares in Float: 7 million<BR>
Completed Biosphere Process Systems Now in Operation: 26<BR>
Potential Size of Market (US/Foreign): Too Large To Calculate<BR>
(Unlimited)<BR>
<BR>
Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy:<BR>
<BR>
LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of<BR>
their Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from<BR>
the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7<BR>
&nbsp;tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste<BR>
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process<BR>
converts into clean, &quot;green&quot; electricity such waste =
materials<BR>
as Municipal Solid Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes,<BR>
medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil,<BR>
sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires. LETH<BR>
profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste<BR>
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-<BR>
watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish<BR>
the local or national grid.<BR>
<BR>
Record Backlog of Sales for LETH:<BR>
<BR>
During the past year, over 20 Biosphere Process Systems have<BR>
been ordered, which upon completion represents a backlog<BR>
exceeding over $100 Million in upcoming sales. Many of these<BR>
contractual agreements include options for the purchase of<BR>
additional Biosphere Systems in the future once the initial<BR>
order has been completed. The options vary from hundreds to<BR>
thousands of units per contract which would send shockwaves<BR>
through this low-float, emerging industry leader at an average<BR>
sale price of $7 Million per Biosphere Process System!<BR>
<BR>
Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:<BR>
<BR>
The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than<BR>
the fact that LETH trading at around $2.00, now has accessible<BR>
capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There<BR>
are 26 Biosphere Process Systems presently in operation worldwide.<BR>
The available funding could easily be used to produce 100<BR>
additional Biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price<BR>
is $7 Million per Biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this<BR>
stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in<BR>
future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!<BR>
<BR>
Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:<BR>
<BR>
LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and<BR>
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the<BR>
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate<BR>
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished<BR>
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the<BR>
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from<BR>
Dr. Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former<BR>
Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature<BR>
has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of<BR>
worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand<BR>
that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.<BR>
<BR>
Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:<BR>
<BR>
We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the<BR>
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere,<BR>
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and<BR>
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly<BR>
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional<BR>
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's<BR>
own sales records. We anticipate the continuation of strong<BR>
positive developments encompassing a major boost when the first<BR>
unit is rolled-out in New Orleans that will ignite LETH shares.<BR>
LETH carries our highest rating for short-term trading profits<BR>
followed by robust long-term capital gains for aggressive<BR>
portfolios looking for homerun performance.<BR>
