<p>The Company has recently announced the acquisition<br>
  of a gold property of approximately 130,000 acres in<br>
  the Amapa State, Brazil. This is one of the most prolific<br>
  greenstone belts in Brazil and has attracted the attention<br>
  of many multi-national mining companies. This acquisition<br>
  could give Globetech a prominent name in the exploration<br>
  of this very hot area of exploration. Globetech, unlike most<br>
  mining companies, has a small number of shares outstanding<br>
  and could see a substantial increase in the price of the stock<br>
  as the investing public becomes aware of the company.<br>
  There are presently only 9.5 million shares outstanding and<br>
  only 3-4 million shares in the public float. There are two<br>
  small cap stock services now following the company with<br>
  buy recommendations and targets of $3-5 in the short term.</p>
<p>On March 31, 2004 Wheaton River Minerals (WHT:AMEX)<br>
  announced a merger with Iamgold (IAG:AMEX) in a<br>
  multi-billion combination. This merger is very important to<br>
  Globetech Ventures as it highlights the value of its newly<br>
  acquired gold property in Amapa State, Brazil. The property<br>
  is adjacent to Wheaton River's most promising gold property<br>
  and is three times the size of Wheaton River's newewst gold<br>
  play. With a market cap of just over $12 million, the is room<br>
  for a large percentage move in the price of the shares in<br>
  Globetech Ventures. The stock is undervalued and should<br>
  move higher aided by higher gold prices. Most gold analysts<br>
  are calling for much higher gold prices.</p>
