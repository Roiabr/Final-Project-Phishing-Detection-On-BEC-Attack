A new teacher was trying to make use of her psychology courses. She =
started her class by saying, "Everyone who thinks you're stupid, stand =
up!" After a few seconds, Little Johnny stood up.The teacher said, "Do =
you think you're stupid, Little Johnny?""No, ma'am, but I hate to see =
you standing there all by yourself!"=B5=B5<br>
When I take a long time, I am slow. When my boss takes a long time, he =
is thorough. When I don't do it, I am lazy. When my boss doesn't do it, =
he is too busy. When I do something without being told, I am trying to =
be smart. When my boss does the same, that is initiative. When I please =
my boss, I am ass-kissing. When my boss pleases his boss, he is =
co-operating. I do good, my boss never remembers. When I do wrong, he =
never forgets<br>
Two men, John and Jim, traveling through the country in America, stopped =
at a small inn for dinner. On the table there was a large cup of =
mustard. Thinking the contents were custard or a sweet of some kind, Jim =
took a spoonful of it and put it in his mouth. Tears ran down his =
cheeks, but wishing to have his friend John caught in the same trap, he =
said nothing of the mistake he had made. The other man, seeing that his =
friend was crying, said: "Listen, Jim, what are crying about?" "I was =
thinking of my father who was hanged twenty years ago," Jim replied. =
Soon after, John took a spoonful of the mustard, and as the tears =
started down his cheeks, Jim in his turn said "What are you crying =
about?" "To think you were not hanged the same day your father was." =
came the answer.<br>
