&quot;entertainment empire&quot;. Name change imminent to reflect<BR>
a treasure-trove of entertainment media properties.<BR>
<BR>
Stock Performance Guide: DRPT<BR>
7 day trading target: 1.20<BR>
30 day trading target: 2.50<BR>
12-Month Est. Average PE X 2004 EPS =3D 3.75<BR>
<BR>
One glance inside DRPT's programming vault will make you<BR>
realize that there is basically none of the Company's<BR>
intrinsic value reflected in the price of the stock.<BR>
This is a direct result of a stock that is completely<BR>
unknown to investors. Watch how quickly prices roar when<BR>
word spreads, investors grab their calculators, and the<BR>
realization is clear that this stock is trading for just<BR>
pennies on every dollar of tangible assets.<BR>
<BR>
The value of the Company's core assets will force its way<BR>
into the stock price, with this explosive entity stepping<BR>
into the spotlight and evolving DRPT into Media Classics<BR>
International, Inc. Although a new name to investors, Media<BR>
Classics is a major video stock footage company with<BR>
worldwide distribution that has amassed a 3,000 film product<BR>
line since 1994.<BR>
<BR>
An overview of Media Classics' holdings reveals a tremendous<BR>
diversity of entertainment media, started from scratch about<BR>
ten years ago that has subsequently morphed into an almost<BR>
$20 Million asset empire with top award winning producers<BR>
and directors at the helm.<BR>
<BR>
The Company's entertainment assets are comprised of over<BR>
2,400 hours of stock film footage, documentary and educational<BR>
films, over $8 Million of animated art and programming,<BR>
distribution rights for 110 full-length feature films<BR>
categorized as top box office draws starring Oscar winners<BR>
and a who's-who of Hollywood actors, as well as sports<BR>
programming, and music rights. This complete library is<BR>
distributed worldwide in VHS, DVD, on cable television and<BR>
via the Internet, and is a continuing source of rapidly<BR>
growing revenues.<BR>
<BR>
Several recent news announcements are well-timed with the<BR>
upcoming corporate name change and will add significant<BR>
value to a growing bottom line. These releases include:<BR>
1. The licensing of 36 films for distribution as DVD's<BR>
and home video through a group of entertainment companies.<BR>
2. The completion of ten (10) documentaries to be released<BR>
within 60 days produced as a joint venture with well-<BR>
known Terramar Productions.<BR>
3. A contract to provide entertainment products to the US<BR>
Navy for use on board ship and at Navy bases around the globe.<BR>
<BR>
Here are some figures that put into perspective the enormous<BR>
potential revenues that are available to industry players<BR>
with diverse entertainment properties. The movie industry<BR>
generates $150 Billion while the entire music industry<BR>
yields $30 Billion worldwide. Video rentals in the US totaled<BR>
$7 Billion, video sales reached $10 Billion, and DVD sales<BR>
totaled $4 Billion for a total of $21 Billion in post-theatrical<BR>
gross profits. With 50% of the wholesale price of a DVD or<BR>
VHS going to the producer or studio, it is clear to aggressive<BR>
investors why DRPT (Media Classics) has become our #1 stock<BR>
pick for 2004.<BR>
