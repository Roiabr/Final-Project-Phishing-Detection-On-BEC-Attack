<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>April 2004 Top Pick of the Month<BR>
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.<BR>
(OTCBB: LETH)<BR>
<BR>
LETH Receives $250,000,000 in Financing to Fund the Manufacture<BR>
of the Environmentally Friendly Biosphere Process System<BR>
&quot;waste-to-energy&quot; Units in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
First Unit to Roll-out in New Orleans in early Second Quarter.<BR>
<BR>
We are expecting earth-shattering upcoming news leading a strong<BR>
rally in LETH for a Company that has announced over $100 Million<BR>
in sales orders in the past year, and tops that record-setting<BR>
achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $8.62 per share in<BR>
cash for major worldwide expansion.<BR>
<BR>
**Our readers grabbed substantial profits for our March pick**<BR>
USHG featured at .75<BR>
Reached 3.65 in 8 days!<BR>
Traded as high as 7.00 since!<BR>
<BR>
The Biosphere Process System - Soaring Worldwide Demand:<BR>
<BR>
LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their<BR>
Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from the disposal<BR>
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour<BR>
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem. This<BR>
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean,<BR>
&quot;green&quot; electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid =
Waste,<BR>
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial<BR>
wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge<BR>
market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale of electricity<BR>
created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by =
generating<BR>
5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to<BR>
replenish the local or national grid.<BR>
<BR>
The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need<BR>
for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding<BR>
universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste.<BR>
LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product<BR>
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a<BR>
major push for generating electricity from alternative sources<BR>
continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power<BR>
failures.<BR>
<BR>
Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:<BR>
<BR>
The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the<BR>
fact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to<BR>
$8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 Biosphere Process<BR>
Systems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding<BR>
could easily be used to produce 100 additional Biospheres. Now =
factor<BR>
in that the average sale price is $7 Million per Biosphere. We<BR>
cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with<BR>
a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million shares<BR>
outstanding!<BR>
<BR>
LETH Stock Guidance:<BR>
Current Price: 1.80<BR>
Near-Term Target: 4.80<BR>
Projected High for '04: 12.50<BR>
<BR>
LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:<BR>
<BR>
LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, =
$21)<BR>
a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, =
mechanical,<BR>
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the US<BR>
Government with annual sales of $800 Million. Tetra Tech will<BR>
coordinate the securing of necessary permits, installation, and<BR>
continuous worldwide monitoring of the Biosphere Process System<BR>
for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of obtaining Department<BR>
of Environmental Quality permitting for the Biosphere Process in<BR>
the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event for LETH which<BR>
opens the floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana while<BR>
having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge<BR>
near-term announcement.<BR>
<BR>
Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:<BR>
<BR>
LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and<BR>
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global<BR>
waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity<BR>
from alternative sources. This has been accomplished by successfully<BR>
creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the<BR>
political contacts at the highest level from Dr. Albert Reynolds,<BR>
Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime Minister of Ireland.<BR>
Dr. Reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding<BR>
LETH into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with<BR>
such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value<BR>
to the size of the market.<BR>
<BR>
Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:<BR>
<BR>
We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the<BR>
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere,<BR>
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and<BR>
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly<BR>
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional<BR>
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's<BR>
own sales records. As our Top Stock Pick for April, we anticipate<BR>
the continuation of strong positive developments that will<BR>
ignite LETH shares which carry our highest rating for short-term<BR>
trading profits followed by robust long-term capital gains.<BR>
