<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
Sorry to bother you.This is a business proposal which I believe you =
might find<BR>
of interest, and also to solicit for your assistance.<BR>
<BR>
My name is Major Jose Santos, I was a high ranking&nbsp; officer of =
the<BR>
fredom fighters&nbsp; group of&nbsp; Southern Angola ( UNITA ) which was =
led by the late<BR>
General Jonas Savimbi who was shot and killed in february 2002 in<BR>
a shoot out with Angolan National army.<BR>
<BR>
At the time of the General's death, I was in Europe, trying to&nbsp; =
purchase&nbsp; military hardware<BR>
for our army on his behalf , because peace talks with the government had =
broken down,<BR>
and a major offensive by government troops was predicted. Unfortunately =
before I could<BR>
conclude the purchase of this military hardware, the news of his death =
was announced.<BR>
<BR>
I was suddenly left with the sum of US$ 26,000,000.00 (Twenty six =
million United States dollars).<BR>
I immediately deposited the money with a safe deposits company =
(securities&nbsp; firm) in and declared it<BR>
as a consignment containing personal valuable items,&nbsp; belonging to =
my foreign affiliate, and sought<BR>
assylum as a political refugee.<BR>
<BR>
My proposal is that,&nbsp; I want you as a trustworthy partner to stand =
as my&nbsp; beneficiary<BR>
and claim this fund on my behalf and have it transferred into your bank =
account, because of my political<BR>
refugee status, the law here do not allow me to hold such private bank =
account with such huge balance,<BR>
without exposing the source of the funds, risking confiscation of the =
funds.<BR>
<BR>
Please note that this transaction demands the highest degree of trust =
and confidentiality between us, moreover<BR>
I can assure you that it is risk- free in the sense that, only three =
people knew about this money and the arms<BR>
purchase&nbsp; i.e, General Savimbi, Capt.John Kowanyi and myself. =
Unfortunately The two died<BR>
the same day in the Government offensive.<BR>
<BR>
I have also taken all proper care of all formalities regarding the =
safety and risk-free of this transaction.<BR>
In appreciation of your assistance , I have worked out the sharing ratio =
for your participation and assistance in this<BR>
transaction as follows :<BR>
<BR>
70% will be&nbsp; for&nbsp; me, which you will invest in your country on =
my behalf under your close supervision and direction,<BR>
<BR>
25%&nbsp; for&nbsp; your participation and assistance.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
5%&nbsp; Set aside to defray any for any upfront expenses we might =
incure in the course of this transaction.<BR>
<BR>
Now the civil war is over, a permanent peace treaty has been signed and =
the country is united. A general<BR>
amnesty has been offered to all the freedom fighters.<BR>
<BR>
The money cannot be traced to me, and I believe now is the right time to =
try to locate a partner with a good<BR>
investment knowledge and start putting the money into a viable =
investment venture to secure a good future for my children.<BR>
<BR>
As I urgently&nbsp; await to hear from you, be informed that all =
communication on this transaction shall be confidential.<BR>
Please, if you'll like to help me, and to earn the 25%, send your reply =
immediately to my ecrypted email: jose-santos@post.com,<BR>
indication your interest to assist me.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, while I await your anticipated co-operation.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
<BR>
Jose Santos<BR>
