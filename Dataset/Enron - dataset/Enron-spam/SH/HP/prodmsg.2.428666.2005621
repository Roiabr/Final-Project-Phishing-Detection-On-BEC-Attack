Dear sir/Madam=20


We want to transfer to overseas the sum of Eighty Four Point Two Million =
United States Dollars (U.S.$84.2,000,000.00) from a bank in Africa.=20

I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who wil=
l be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set=
 up a new bank account immediately to receive this money,though an empty =
bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest t=
o me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believin=
g in God that you will never let me down either now or in time to come.=20

I am Mr.Edward Moko.the external auditor of a Bank.During the course of o=
ur auditing,I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank=
 in 1998 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account gain.After go=
ing through some old files in the records, I discovered that the owner of=
 the account died without a "Heir apparent to the throne" hence the money=
 is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be for=
feited for nothing. The owner of this account who is Mr.Eshed.B.Willey, a=
 foreigner and an industrialist died, since 1998,until now no other perso=
n(s) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence conc=
erning this account. As such this account has no other beneficiary and my=
 investigation proved to me as well that Eshed.B.Willey until his death w=
as the manager Oriental Diamond Company,in South Africa. However, if you =
are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer wi=
th Thirty Four Point Two Million U.S.Dollars(U.S.$34.2,000,000.00) upon s=
uccessful transaction without any disappointment from you. We shall also =
re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account. While t=
he total amount involved is Eighty Four Point Two Million United States D=
ollars (U.S.$84.2,000,000.00)only. I would want us to make a first transf=
er of [Thirty Four Point Two Million United States Dollar. U.S.$34.2,000,=
000.00)from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the r=
est. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not b=
e approved to a local account, without valid international foreign "Agree=
ment", but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid internation=
al credentials: passport or drivers license and foreign account because t=
his sum is in U.S. dollars and the former owner of the account Mr.Eshed.B=
=2EWilley is a foreigner too, thus the money could only be approved into =
a foreign account. However, knowing all this, we will reach a binding agr=
eement in this regards.=20

As a matter of urgency,I will inform you the next step to take, while you=
 Send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of=
 the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face t=
o build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us toge=
ther before transferring the money to any account of your choice where th=
e fund will be safe. Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharin=
g and investments,I need your full co-operation to make this business a s=
uccess, because the management is ready to approve this payment to any fo=
reigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to=
 you,upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are cap=
able and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is=
 deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance t=
hat you will never let me down. With my influence and the position in the=
 bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account whic=
h you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending o=
ur physical arrival in your country for sharing. And to build confidence =
that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which=
 I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to=
 your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account=
=2E I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you=
 that you are ready to act as directed. To prove the authenticity of the =
business I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approva=
ls for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate cle=
arance from the relevant ministries, foreign exchange departments, embass=
y and Board of Internal Revenue Services. At the conclusion of this busin=
ess, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while=
 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this pro=
cess.=20


I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.=20


Respectfully=20


Mr.Edward Moko.=20
