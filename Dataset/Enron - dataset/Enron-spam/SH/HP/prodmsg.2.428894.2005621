          <p>Megola Inc. is a publicly traded company operating in the multi-billion dollar water treatment industry, serving a wide variety of residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural clients. The company serves its clients by supplying products and tailor-made solutions to solve physical water treatment, microbiological control, wastewater treatment and air purification problems. Megola's solutions enable companies to save money and boost productivity. The world is becoming more environmentally conscious. This is yet another trend that could benefit Megola's business, as Megola's physical water treatment solutions do not require the use of salt or harmful chemicals. </p>
          <p><font color="#0000FF"><strong><font size="3">Business Model</font></strong></font></p>
          <p>Megola's model is based on forming powerful alliances with its clients. Instead of merely selling water treatment products, Megola wants to position itself as the leading total service provider in its industry. Megola teams up with its clients and becomes their business partner by assuming total responsibility for solving their water or air related problems </p>
          <p>Megola's goal is to minimize its clients' costs and maximize their productivity and profitability. In the past few years, Megola has learned a lot about the specific problems various industries are encountering with water and air quality. Megola has learned how to solve those problems and by doing so, saved its clients hundreds of thousands of dollars. </p>
          <p><font size="3"><strong><font color="#0000FF">Mark</font></strong><font color="#0000FF"><strong>et Potential</strong></font></font></p>
          <p>The U. S.  corrosion and scale-inhibitors industry, combined with the softener industry, is worth $737 million, and estimated to grow to $775 million by 2007. The U. S.  water treatment chemical market is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 4.1%, reaching more than $2.7 billion by 2007. </p>
          <p>Hard water is present in approximately 80% of North American households. Due to environmental issues, a growing number of communities in North America are banning the use of traditional salt softeners. This creates a powerful market opportunity for Megola and its revolutionary, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly ScaleGuard system. Areas such as Southern California and Texas , where water quality issues abound, are potential hotspots of market activity for environmental solutions to hard water problems. </p>

BuyMax alone brings <strong>over 600 dealers </strong> to the network of buying and installing Megola products and now Megola is introducing their recently acquired ultraviolet (UV) water disinfection systems to the BuyMax network. Megola is also testing a Surface Disinfection System (SDS) for grocery stores. By using ozonated water to destroy the bacteria that contribute to the decomposition of produce, this disinfection system will increase produce quality and shelf life.</font></p>
