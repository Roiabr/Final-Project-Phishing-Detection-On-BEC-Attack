how her big brother tried to pull a fast one.  You'll enjoy it as 
much as she did.

SUMMER GULL-IBILITY
by Kay Seefeldt

      When island kids are released on the last day of the school, the 
euphoria can be felt all the way to the mainland!
      Summer vacation equals freedom!  A time to be free like the 
ever-present, ravenous gulls on outstretched wings keeping a watchful 
eye out for unguarded tidbits.
      As a kid, the lazy, hazy days of summer seemed to stretch into 
infinity.  A gift of seventy-five precious days to do as I pleased.
      My first mission was to head to the general store, a stone's 
throw from our house.
      With one thin dime the fisherman or fisher-girl got a real 
bargain -- a length of green twine on a spool and two shiny black 
hooks (that wouldn't be shiny for long), one lead sinker, and a 
summer of shear pleasure.
      Between tides, I'd fit in baseball, Tarzan swings, frog hunting, 
marbles, and playing school.  High tides found me a few yards from 
our house on the end of my deceased grandfather's wharf.  I'd be on 
the dry end of a fishing line, with a baited hook dangling in the 
cold Atlantic waters, awaiting the tug of a harbor pollack.
      To me, the wharf -- at that time run by my uncle and dad -- was 
the most exciting place on our small island community.  Fishermen 
selling their lobster catch, wharf hands scrambling up or down the 
ladders, boat engines roaring, gulls squawking overhead, and free 
bait for them and me.
      On rainy days, men would gather in the small shop.  The wood 
stove kept every body toasty warm while they told their fish stories. 
Best of all, a glass case full candy bars offered its sweet contents 
in exchange for a nickel.
      Daddy showed me how to clean the fish and pickle them overnight 
in salt brine.  By deft use of a blade, I could cut the head off and 
gut the fish in one precise movement.  The next morning, I'd match 
the fish up by size and tie two together by their tails, or three if 
I had an "odd fish out" to hang over the clothesline behind our 
house.  My fish were organized on the clothesline, smallest to 
largest.
      Then I'd be ready to catch another batch.
      My hands perpetually smelled of fish perfume, enough to make any 
tomboy proud.
      Like a miser, I'd count my horde every day.  If flies were 
trying to "blow my fish", I'd pepper the gullet openings hoping to 
keep them from using my fish as an incubator.  These dried fish would 
taste mighty good in the cold of winter with mashed potatoes and 
cream style corn.  Some would be summer treats.
      Occasionally, I'd discover I had several fish less than the day 
before.  Some of the smallest would be missing.  When I mentioned my 
loss of fish, my brother said, "Probably some hungry gull after a 
free meal."
      Determined to keep the gulls at bay, I tied several brown paper 
bags to the clothes line in strategic locations.  But still the 
smallest, driest fish continued to disappear.
      One afternoon, my tomboy intuition told me to check on my fish 
for thieving gulls.  There stood the "gull" -- jackknife in hand, 
peeling the skin off the driest of the fish.
      "I'm inspecting these to see if you salted them correctly," he 
informed me as if he were an FDA agent.
      In my eyes, no matter what my brother did was fine by me.  No 
matter what he told me, I swallowed his every word -- hook, line and 
sinker.
      You could say I was the gull-ible one.
      And I still am, where my brother is concerned.  He is loved as 
much today as he was in years gone by, maybe even more, for adding 
such colorful memories to my life.

This story was a gift of words to her brother who celebrated his 
birthday on June 7.  By the way, "blowing the fish" means the flies 
were laying eggs in them.

FROM OUR MAILBAG
(in response to our last story, 10,000 Years...)

Dear Heartwarmers:
      Thank you, Diane for sharing your lovely story with us.  What a 
privilege to know and to be related to such a wonderful man!
               -- Jackie     <jackiegriffith @ cox.net>

Dear Heartwarmers:
      I was really blessed with that story.  Diane's grandfather had a 
beautiful heart for the Lord.  Most of all she is appreciative of his 
gifts to her and her family.  It takes a heart to show appreciation 
towards the good things one has planted in one's heart.  Diane, 
thanks for being appreciative of Grandpa's doings in your life.  Wish 
I had such grandpa.
            -- George, Lagos, Nigeria     <gojiegbe @ jhplc.com>

Dear Heartwarmers:
      WOW!  Diane's story about her grandfather-in-law filled my eyes 
with tears and my heart with Amazing Grace.  Who can resist that 
simple song that is loved and sung by people of all faiths.  It was 
the comfort after September 11th, and it is the world's most 
treasured hymn.  It has given me hope when I felt hopeless, and it 
always reminds me that this life is but for a moment -- that the only 
thing we will ever take with us when we leave this planet, is what 
we've given away.  In 10,000 years the things we count as riches 
today will have given way to what we have done for others.  Well 
said, Diane, and a fitting tribute for a true man of God.
               -- Jaye Lewis   <jlewis @ smyth.net>

Grace says:  Mallory, 3, and grandma were playing when Mallory wanted 
to listen to some music.  She noticed some old 33-1/3 RPM records 
that had Disney characters on the cover.  She was curious and had to 
open one.  Upon pulling the record out of the sleeve, she said, "Boy, 
Grandma, this is a really big CD!"
