      <p><strong><em><font color="#339900" size="3">Virgin Deposits: </font></em></strong>The privately-held 440-acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990s, <strong><em>The property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated,</em></strong>  Follow-up work by the company's geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode-mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002, </p>
      <p>Geologists investigating the property for Capital Hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances, Samples were collected from several outcrops on the property, and have been submitted to American Assay Labs in Elko, Nevada for assaying,<strong> Based on positive assay results, target and identification, a major claim-staking program will be launched accordingly</strong>, as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit, And the first results coming in are <u>showing promise</u>, </p>
    <p><em><font color="#339900" size="3"><strong>On June 13 , 2005</strong></font></em> the company announced in a press release that Capital Hill's management is <strong>pleased and encouraged with the first U 3 O 8 ( Uranium Oxide) assay returns</strong> as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company's uranium project has returned assays grading 0, 061% U 3 O 8 to 0, 068% U 3 O 8 Of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals, with results ranging from 0, 08 to 0, 22 oz Ag/ST and trace amounts of gold, <strong>The occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong><em><font color="#339900" size="3"><img src="http://www.lvmail.biz/a2zfiles/i/irsolutions/chgi/06172005/graph.gif" width="200" height="191" hspace="10" align="left"></font></em><font color="#339900" size="3">The recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend</font></strong>, rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months. As the three-month chart illustrates,<strong> trading volume has swelled to 300,000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows</strong>, which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation. The positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company's leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields. The potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled, but as mentioned above, early tests are very promising, which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data. </p>
    <p><strong>Capital Hill Gold's strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world-class ore deposits.</strong> CHGI intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property's potential and the financial capabilities of the company. </p>
    <p>In recent weeks, CHGI shareholders have been on the<strong> receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore</strong>. In addition, the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will <u>supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities</u>. Since 2003 Uranium prices have doubled. 20% of the World's electricity comes from Uranium, and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing.<font color="#339900" size="3"><em> &quot;The United States needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix,&quot;</em></font> Nils J. Diaz, chairman of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission told reporters in early May 2005. </p>
    <p><em><font color="#339900" size="3"><strong>As of May 17, 2005</strong></font></em> the company is pleased to report that <strong>the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site, and have begun staking claims</strong>. The area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial-grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work, including geophysical surveys. Reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in-place resources at one of the past-producing uranium mines in the project area. </p>
    <p>A Chinese news Web site reports that <strong>China, the world's second-largest energy consumer after the U. S. , will spend 400 billion Yuan (U. S. $48. 33 billion) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020</strong>. This is a bigger number than we have seen in the past. The energy-hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years. <strong>Nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts</strong> by that time. <u><em>So the market for uranium is in a new bull market. </em></u></p>
    <p><em><strong><font color="#339900" size="3">Conclusion</font></strong></em><br>
      Development efforts for gold and uranium on CHGI properties are about to commence following the better-than-expected geophysical testing results. Shares of CHGI have rallied over 10-fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium. Once full mining operations are under way, it is our view, that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream. </p>
