Unclaimed Fund (Late Engr. Douglas Briggs Estate)
 
I am sending you this private email to make a passionate appeal to you for =
assistance. Kindly accept my apology for contacting you this way and forgive =
me if this is not acceptable to you. My name is Henry Ossai; I am an auditor =
at one of the Nigerian Banks in Lagos-Nigeria.

During our last audit exercise, some amount of money totaling $18.5Million =
was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Douglas Briggs, a =
foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund was further traced to =
be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now. Since =
his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted our =
curiosity. I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave =
any next of kin in his confidential document with the Ministry that he =
executed the contract for and also with our Bank. A panel setup by the =
Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be =
unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or =
alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a =
military war college here in Nigeria.
 
Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of =
the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. It is because of the =
perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin (he =
had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, =
Rtd Major General Thomas Dan Ababa, that arrangement is being made for the =
fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for =
arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in =
Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues =
and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could =
assist in claiming this fund for further transfer abroad. I have been given =
the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.

All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully =
worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share =
would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be =
set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would =
be for us for investment purposes in your country after the transfer. If this =
proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we =
hope to bestow on you or your company, then kindly reach me Immediately via =
my confidential email account <mrhenrygroup@wanadoo.es> furnishing me with =
your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that =
I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction.

I will be waiting for your response. My telephone number is +234 803 650 =
4986.
.
Regards,
Mr. Henry Ossai
