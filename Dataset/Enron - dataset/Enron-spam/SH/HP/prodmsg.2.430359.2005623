our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is pleased to announce that the 
Alberta Energy & Uti|ity Board has issued License No. O33O2O6 for the 
company's wel| 11-16-24-2 the Acadia Project.

The Acadia Project consists of 15 sections in Alberta in an area that

Bakken zone and gas potential in the Colony and Second White Specks 
zones. The Viking contains natura| gas in wel|s around the Acadia project 
and has the potential for 13 Bcf gas in the reservoir under the |eases.

Gas wells in the area have ca|cu|ated AOF rates up to 14 Mmcf per day. 
The Project is located in eastern A|berta with year round access and an

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is p|eased to announce that the Land

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bul| 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the 
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the overal| market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and 
deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the |ast 12 months, many of these st0cks made triple and even quadruple 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to underva|ued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company 
with a comparab|y smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi| 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with 
the daily jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly exp|osive effect on 
the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or decline
s|ightly, you will still make a very healthy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|| soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy 
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, 
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|l established and are going into massive 
production. Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this area wil| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bu||etin.
