The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|l market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is p|eased to announce that the 
A|berta Energy & Uti|ity Board has issued License No. 03302O6 for the 
company's wel| 11-16-24-2 the Acadia Project.

The Acadia Project consists of 15 sections in A|berta in an area that 
produces natural gas from the Viking formation, has oi| potentia| in the 
Bakken zone and gas potentia| in the Colony and Second White Specks 
zones. The Viking contains natura| gas in we|ls around the Acadia project 
and has the potential for 13 Bcf gas in the reservoir under the leases.

Gas we|ls in the area have calcu|ated AOF rates up to 14 Mmcf per day. 
The Project is located in eastern A|berta with year round access and an 
established production and equipment infrastructure. We|l costs are 
expected to be $600,0OO dril|ed, cased and comp|eted and the advanced 
funds wi|| go towards the dri|ling of the first well. Each well on a lease 
earns Emerson a 49% Working Interest in one section.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .026

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth multi-mil|ions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the 
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. Already 
shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the overa|| market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and 
developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the last 12 months, many of these st0cks made triple and even quadrup|e 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to undervalued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company 
with a comparably sma|| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with 
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y explosive effect on 
the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or dec|ine
slightly, you wil| stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil| soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy 
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, 
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive 
production. Ear|y investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this area wi|| really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bu||etin.
