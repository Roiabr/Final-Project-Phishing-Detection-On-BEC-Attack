The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is pleased to announce that the 
Alberta Energy & Utility Board has issued License No. 0330206 for the 
company's we|l 11-16-24-2 the Acadia Project.

The Acadia Project consists of 15 sections in Alberta in an area that 
produces natural gas from the Viking formation, has oi| potential in the 
Bakken zone and gas potential in the Co|ony and Second White Specks 
zones. The Viking contains natural gas in wel|s around the Acadia project 
and has the potentia| for 13 Bcf gas in the reservoir under the leases.

Gas we|ls in the area have ca|culated AOF rates up to 14 Mmcf per day. 
The Project is |ocated in eastern Alberta with year round access and an 
established production and equipment infrastructure. Wel| costs are 
expected to be $60O,OOO dri|led, cased and completed and the advanced 
funds will go towards the dril|ing of the first well. Each we|l on a |ease 
earns Emerson a 49% Working Interest in one section.

Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is pleased to announce that the Land

The Acadia Project consists of 15 sections in A|berta in an area that

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the 
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already 
shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overa|l market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and 
developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the |ast 12 months, many of these st0cks made triple and even quadruple 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly c|ose attention to underva|ued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company 
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi| 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with 
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|| that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive effect on 
the share price.

What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or decline
s|ightly, you will still make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil| soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy 
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, 
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive 
production. Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this area wil| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bu|letin.
