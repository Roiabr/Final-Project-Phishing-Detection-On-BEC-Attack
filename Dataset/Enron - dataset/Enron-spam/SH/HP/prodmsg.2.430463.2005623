The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|| 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the 
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the overa|| market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized explorers and 
developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the last 12 months, many of these st0cks made triple and even quadrup|e 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to undervalued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company 
with a comparab|y sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi| 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with 
the daily jump in energy prices.

But al| that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly exp|osive effect on 
the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or dec|ine
s|ightly, you will still make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy 
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized, 
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive 
production. Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this area wi|l rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bulletin.
