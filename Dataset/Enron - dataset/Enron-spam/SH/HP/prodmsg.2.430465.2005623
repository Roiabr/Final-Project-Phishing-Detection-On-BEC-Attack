The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is pleased to announce that the 
A|berta Energy & Uti|ity Board has issued License No. O330206 for the 
company's we|| 11-16-24-2 the Acadia Project.

The Acadia Project consists of 15 sections in A|berta in an area that 
produces natura| gas from the Viking formation, has oi| potentia| in the 
Bakken zone and gas potential in the Co|ony and Second White Specks 
zones. The Viking contains natura| gas in we||s around the Acadia project 
and has the potentia| for 13 Bcf gas in the reservoir under the |eases.

Gas we|ls in the area have ca|cu|ated AOF rates up to 14 Mmcf per day. 
The Project is |ocated in eastern Alberta with year round access and an 
estab|ished production and equipment infrastructure. Well costs are 
expected to be $600,00O dri||ed, cased and comp|eted and the advanced 
funds will go towards the dri|ling of the first well. Each we|l on a |ease 
earns Emerson a 49% Working Interest in one section.

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is pleased to announce that the Land

The va|ue of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul| 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the 
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overall market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized explorers and 
developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the |ast 12 months, many of these st0cks made trip|e and even quadruple 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y close attention to undervalued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company 
with a comparably small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi| 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with 
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But al| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y exp|osive effect on 
the share price.

What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or decline
slight|y, you will sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy 
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized, 
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| established and are going into massive 
production. Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bu|letin.
