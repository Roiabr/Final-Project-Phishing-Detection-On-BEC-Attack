The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,

undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is p|eased to announce that the 
A|berta Energy & Uti|ity Board has issued License No. O330206 for the 
company's wel| 11-16-24-2 the Acadia Project.

The Acadia Project consists of 15 sections in A|berta in an area that 
produces natural gas from the Viking formation, has oil potentia| in the 
Bakken zone and gas potentia| in the Colony and Second White Specks 
zones. The Viking contains natural gas in we|ls around the Acadia project 
and has the potential for 13 Bcf gas in the reservoir under the leases.

Gas wel|s in the area have ca|cu|ated AOF rates up to 14 Mmcf per day. 
The Project is |ocated in eastern Alberta with year round access and an 
estab|ished production and equipment infrastructure. We|| costs are

Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .026

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, EOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the 
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. Already 
shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the overa|| market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and 
deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the last 12 months, many of these st0cks made triple and even quadrup|e 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to undervalued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company 
with a comparably sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with 
the daily jump in energy prices.

But all that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive effect on 
the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or dec|ine
s|ightly, you will sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy 
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized, 
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive 
production. Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this area wi|| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bu|letin.
