additional investors to participate in the long-term goals and objectives of 
Western.

Commenting on the proposed transaction, the president of Western Sierra 
Mining, Michael Chaffee, said, "The new a|ignment with OreTech wi|| 
al|ow each of the companies to uti|ize their specific expertise to the 
maximum benefit of the other. OreTech is trying to focus on developing its
