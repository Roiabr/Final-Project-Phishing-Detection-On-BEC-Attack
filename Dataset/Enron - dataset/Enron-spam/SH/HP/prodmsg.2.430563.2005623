potential of Mi|lions per week.

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is p|eased to announce that the

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the 
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already 
shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the overa|| market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and 
developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the last 12 months, many of these st0cks made trip|e and even quadruple 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to underva|ued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|| company 
with a comparably sma|l market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with 
the daily jump in energy prices.

But all that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive effect on 
the share price.

What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oil and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or decline
s|ight|y, you wi|| stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|| soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy 
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized, 
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive 
production. Early investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this area wil| really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bulletin.
