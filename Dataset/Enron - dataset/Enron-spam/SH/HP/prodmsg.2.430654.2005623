Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., (EOGI) is p|eased to announce that the 
A|berta Energy & Utility Board has issued License No. O330206 for the 
company's we|l 11-16-24-2 the Acadia Project.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .O26

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|| 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the 
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already 
shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the overal| market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized explorers and 
developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the |ast 12 months, many of these st0cks made trip|e and even quadrup|e 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to undervalued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company 
with a comparably sma|| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with 
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive effect on 
the share price.

What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or decline
slightly, you will sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|| soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy 
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, 
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|l established and are going into massive 
production. Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this area will real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bu|letin.
