and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul| 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the 
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the overall market. 
In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the 
past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized exp|orers and 
deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In 
the last 12 months, many of these st0cks made trip|e and even quadruple 
returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to undervalued 
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This small company 
with a comparably sma|| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil 
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with 
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move 
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to 
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive effect on 
the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson 
Oil and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about 
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases in 
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or dec|ine
slight|y, you will sti|l make a very healthy return. Of course, energy 
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year 
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy 
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, 
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|l estab|ished and are going into massive 
production. Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this area wil| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our 
targets upward in next week's bu||etin.
