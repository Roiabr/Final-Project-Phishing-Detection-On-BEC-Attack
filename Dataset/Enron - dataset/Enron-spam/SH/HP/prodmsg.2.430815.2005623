SMALL-CAP ST0CK FINDER

 
New Developments Expected To Move Western Sierra Mining, Inc. St0ck
From  0.70 To Over  4.00

westernsierramining .com


Western Sierra Mining is a company on the move, fast!  Big news is out!  
Big business is afoot for WSRM!


Read on to find out why WSRM is our TOP pick this week.



* Western Sierra Mining has a very profitable business model in which 
they avoid the highest cost associate with mining: Exploration.  
Essentially, Wester Sierra operates mines on sites that have been previously 
explored and found to be "too small" for the largest mining companies, 
yet still produce handsome profits.

* The global mining industry boom will continue for the foreseeable 
future due to the impact of China-driven demand on commodity prices and 
long supply-response lead times.

* News! News! News!  Read on to find out why we expect WSRM to take off 
this week!

 
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 15, 2005--Western Sierra Mining Corp. 
(Pink Sheets: WSRM - News) announced today that the board of directors 
has approved and authorized a 2-for-1 forward split of its issued and 
outstanding common s-t0ck to all shareholders of record as of June 26, 
2005. 

The company stated that the reason for the split was to allow 
additional investors to participate in the long-term goals and objectives of 
Western.



PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 10, 2005--Western Sierra Mining (Pink 
Sheets: WSRM - News) and OreTech Inc. (Pink Sheets: ORTE - News) 
announced today that their respective boards of directors have agreed to enter 
into an agreement to develop the Silver Plume and Pittsburg mines 
located in Colorado. 

Commenting on the proposed transaction, the president of Western Sierra 
Mining, Michael Chaffee, said, "The new alignment with OreTech will 
allow each of the companies to utilize their specific expertise to the 
maximum benefit of the other. OreTech is trying to focus on developing its 
propriety extraction technology and Western is expanding its mining 
activities in the U.S. We have started our due diligence on the property 
and look forward to taking a proposal back to OreTech by the end of the 
month.


PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 2005--Western Sierra Mining (Pink 
Sheets: WSRM - News) announced today that it has signed a Letter of Intent 
with ASDI Corp. providing WSRM the right to develop the ASDI property 
located in Crescent Valley at Battle Mountain, Nev.



We cannot stress enough the significance of this news.  A s-t0ck split 
can only mean one thing; GOOD BUSINESS!  With the split date set at June 
26, NOW is obviously the time to get in.  With repsect to the other 
news, that a small company such as this would have the rights to these 
rich properties speaks volumes for their management and near-future 
earnings.  That they would be so fortunate as to be involved with an industry 
pioneer such as Oretech is nothing short of extraordinary.

These fortuitous events have earned WSRM our highly recommendation

Industrial Average over the last three years.

* Profits by mining companies have doubled for the second year in a 
row.  Return on equity has increased nearly three-fold over the past two 
years

* Price Waterhouse Coopers calls for "...another bumper year for the 
global mining industry in 2005."  They go on to say, "The sustained 
upturn in commodity prices has caught investors' attention, creating a dash 
for mining s-t0cks.  Add the unprecedented profits and free cash flows 
and we have a very buoyant industry."
