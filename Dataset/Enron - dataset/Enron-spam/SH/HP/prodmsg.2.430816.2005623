	color: #FF0000;">CHALLENGE:</P> 
            <P>While the U.S. economy has been sluggish, e-commerce has never been hotter! According to Forrester Research , U.S. retail e-commerce sales eclipsed $136.6 billion in 2004, an increase of 20% from 2003.</P> 
            <P>Put another way: E-commerce grew THREE TIMES faster than retail sales as a whole for the same period!</P> 
            <P>But there is a dark cloud on the horizon. There are more than 22 million small businesses in the U.S. , the vast majority with fewer than a dozen employees . They represent 50% of the entire U.S. economy and 75% of all new jobs... and yet these businesses find it increasingly difficult to cash in on the e-commerce revolution. It's becoming harder and harder to design and maintain online stores... set up merchant accounts... control web-based inventories... and package and ship products.</P> 
            <P>As consumers increasingly demand web catalogs and instant online shopping, MILLIONS of small businesses are missing out.</P> 
            <P>Without a state of the art web site... a wide variety of competitively-priced products and services... and cutting-edge ordering and payment options... these small businesses and entrepreneurs are losing BILLIONS of dollars in potential profits.</P> 
            <P>And because small businesses provide most of the new jobs in America , the ripple effect of this failure to offer online shopping could dramatically slow down the economic recovery of the country as a whole.</P> 
            <P>Plus, that's only HALF of the problem. There are millions more people and businesses that would like to sell items on eBay... but they either don't own computers or don't want to be bothered with listing and photographing items on eBay. </P> 
            <P><B>&#133;&#133;&#133;.NWWV has the ultimate SOLUTION</B></P> 
            <P>Fortunately, NWWV has developed easy, cost-effective solutions to these e-commerce challenges!</P> 
            <P><SPAN style="color: #FF0000; font-weight: bold;">FIRST:</SPAN> <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG>, through its web portal Online supplier.com, helps small businesses and entrepreneurs get in on the e-commerce revolution by providing a &#147;turn key&#148; online store with dynamic content...hundreds of products selling at up to 50% below retail price... access to merchant account services... and direct shipping to buyers. For a small monthly fee, <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> allows businesses to have an instant online retail presence.</P> 
            <P><SPAN style="color: #FF0000; font-weight: bold;">SECOND: </SPAN><STRONG>NWWV's</STRONG> other  subsidiary, Auction Liquidator, has established a relationship with FedEx to provide it with nationwide network of drop-off centers that will let anyone to sell an item on eBay by just dropping it off at any one of the 5,000 FedEx or Kinkos locations without ever touching a computer. AuctionLiquidator will handle the entire transaction for the seller &#150; and simply send him or her a check once the item sells.</P> 
            <P><STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> recently launched a national radio advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman Bob Eubanks, longtime TV host of &#147;The Newlywed Game&#148; and well-known music impresario. <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> is currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in July 2005.</P>

	color: #0000FF;"><B>7 </B><B>BIG </B><B> reasons to consider NWWV before its stock could jump from $1.50 a share to $15</B></SPAN></P> 
            <P><SPAN style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;">1. </SPAN> <B>NWWV</B> has innovated the e-commerce industry: As a one-stop online wholesaler and e-commerce facilitator, <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> helps thousands of entrepreneurs and small businesses take advantage of the explosion in online shopping and auctioneering.  According to Forrester Research, e-commerce sales will hit $175 billion this year and $310 billion by 2010 &#150; and <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> is smack dab in the middle of it.</P> 
            <P><SPAN style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;">2. </SPAN> <B>NWWV's </B>&#147;online auction drop-off&#148; concept could bring in millions of more auction customers and capture a significant portion of a potential $10 billion market. eBay itself estimates that several million people would like to sell items on its service but don't know how to use computers. A company like <STRONG>NWWV </STRONG>that has established a drop-off presence with FedEx &#150; and already has an established online auction wholesale business &#150; could become the dominant player in a brand-new, growth segment of e-commerce.</P> 
            <P><SPAN style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;">3. </SPAN> <B>NWWV's</B> growth has been nothing short of EXPLOSIVE. Within three months of its launch in August 2003, <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> had monthly sales of $348,000. For 2004 <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> just reported annual sales of $6.8 million in just their first full calendar year of business and just announced <B><u>it surpassed over $1 million in monthly sales!</u></B></P> 
            <P><SPAN style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;">4. </SPAN> Like eBay and uBid, <STRONG>NWWV's</STRONG> growth potential is virtually unlimited. A tiny web site with just the right combination of e-commerce solutions and products can grow at an exponential rate. Already, <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> has serviced more than 150,000 paid members... and is receiving over 6,000 new online inquires per day. If only 1% of them join the <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> online shopping club, <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> would TRIPLE its rate of growth.</P> 
            <P><SPAN style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;">5. </SPAN> <STRONG>NWWV's</STRONG> monthly fee of $29.95 per month guarantees a steady flow of revenue. This guarantees the company a source of revenue for its ongoing marketing campaigns. </P> 
            <P>As an online wholesale shopping club, <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> also makes money from sales of the top-quality products offered through its web portal, Onlinesupplier.com.</P> 
            <P><SPAN style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;">6. </SPAN> <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> recently launched a national radio advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesman Bob Eubanks, longtime TV host of &#147;The Newlywed Game&#148; and well-known music impresario. <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> is also currently in production for their first infomercial which is scheduled for nationwide broadcast beginning in July 2005.</P> 
            <P><SPAN style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000;">7. </SPAN> By my calculations, <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> would only need increase annual sales ten-fold to $68 million for its stock to potentially skyrocket from $1.50 a share today to $15 a share. It's risky, but would turn every $10,000 invested into almost $100,000. If the current growth continues,<STRONG> NWWV</STRONG> could potentially meet sales numbers like that in 24 months or less. Is it possible for a new company like NWWV to grow that fast? You better believe it! Annual sales of $68 million represent only a miniscule portion &#150; just 0.05% &#150; of the $136 BILLION in total e-commerce sales... which are growing at the staggering rate of 20% per year. </P>

            <P style="font-size: 18px;

	color: #FF0000;">Dear Investor:</P>
            <P>The only sure path to investment wealth is to find breakthrough new companies before anyone else does &#150; and buy them when they're still dirt cheap. In this special issue, I am blowing the lid on <STRONG>NWWV</STRONG> &#150; a brand-new e-commerce company that is in the process of revolutionizing the burgeoning online auction market. It's an online &#147;shopping club&#148; that lets ordinary people set up, maintain and grow their own auction businesses for just pennies a day. And according to Forrester Research, this year online auctions will represent fully 25% of a $175 billion e-commerce market.</P>
            <P>Read this report and you will discover why I believe<STRONG> NWWV</STRONG> could turn a $10,000 investment into $100,000 within just 24 months or sooner! But don't delay. This company already has 150,000 members... its first calendar year annual sales hit almost $7 million!... and is still growing This stock has the potential to be a HUGE winner. </P>
            <P><B>DON'T MISS OUT! </B><BR>

        </TR>
      </TABLE>      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I don't think I've ever been more excited about a stock &#150; and that's saying a lot. I won't kid you, either: This is one of those stocks that may scare off some investors, but which <STRONG>has the potential to make you, not 5 times your money, but 10 or even 20 times your money</STRONG>. It's risky, but with potential profits like those, I think it's a risk you should consider. </P>      
      <P>Back in 1995, two guys got together in a San Jose , California , living room to discuss launching a new online shopping business. They didn't want to sell products themselves, like the new company Amazon.com. They simply wanted to help people and businesses sell their products to one another. The new web site would make its money from a small upfront fee for using the service... and a small percentage of the price of the products sold on the site (between 1% and 5%, depending upon the price).</P> 
      <P><STRONG>Most people, of course, thought Pierre Omi-dyar and Jeff Skoll were crazy. When their company first went public, its stock only sold for $3 a share. Talk about a small stock! But a year later, no one thought they were crazy. Every $10,000 invested in eBay grew into $166,000 in 12 months. And after just nine years in business, <SPAN style="color: #FF0000">eBay today has 100 million registered users, a total market cap of $52 billion and annual net revenues in excess of $3 billion.</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
      <P>I only bring this up to remind you of the astonishing potential of the right e-commerce stock. Quite frankly, most of them never get off the ground. The dot.com bust taught us that a bright idea is not enough, that you have to have a solid business plan and substantial growth in revenues to create a winner. But when you do find a winner, the profits you can make are simply outstanding.</P> 
      <P><STRONG>The company I am going to introduce to you in this issue is just such a breakthrough e-commerce stock. It has the potential to become another HUGE winner. It is the first company I know of to combine the concepts of wholesale shopping clubs and drop-off consignment stores with the exponential power of e-commerce and Internet auctions. Like eBay, it makes its money both from membership fees as well as from a percentage of the actual sales on its web sites and through its drop-off consignment stores. And its sales are growing at a rate of more than 21%... per month.</STRONG></P> 
      <P>I've seen just how fast an e-commerce business can take off when it has the right concept at the right time. I believe this new stock is just such a company.</P> 
      <P>Get ready for yet another potential huge winner! Read this report right now, take action, and be prepared for potentially MASSIVE profits.</P>

      <P><BR>
        Jack Burney has a long and successful career in financial media.<BR>
        He has more than 55 years of experience as a stock analyst<BR>

        and investment advisor. He was a business editor for the Dallas<BR>
        Times Herald and a leading financial writer for the OTC News<BR>
        Network. However, he was so disgusted by the poor advice and<BR>
        even worst stock recommendations of the mainstream media, he<BR>
        decided to launch his own series of elite publications for serious<BR>
        investors. To date, his VIP special reports &#150; including Biotech<BR>

        Fortunes, Hitech Fortunes and Institutional Fortunes &#150; have see<BR>
        stock picks with returns as high as 256% in a matter of weeks.<BR>
        Unfortunately, the only way you can get Jack Burney&#146;s advice is<BR>
        through these special reports, normally made available only by<BR>
        subscription and at a substantial price. (The premier subscription<BR>

        price for the Stock Trader News, for all new subscribers, is<BR>
      scheduled to double to $1,298 in October.)</P>
      <P><BR>
        <SPAN style="color: #FF0000">WARNNG: If you&#146;re not a subscriber to one of Jack&#146;s publications,<BR>
        and have received an issue in error, then please: DO NOT<BR>
        READ THIS PUBLICATION. It is written for serious investors<BR>

        only. Jack Burney&#146;s track record is impeccable, but these highly<BR>
        confidential stock recommendations are for serious investors<BR>
        who hope to make 200% to 300% profits as a minimum.</SPAN></P>      <P>&nbsp;</P>
