"I just wanted to write and thank you for Spur-M. 
I suffered from poor sperm count and motility. I found 
your site and ordered Spur-M Fertility Blend for Men. 
I have wondered for years what caused low semen and sperm 
count, and how I could improve my fertility and help my wife
conceive. Spur-M seems to have done just that! Thank you
for your support."
Andrew H., London, UK

"Spur-M really does help improve fertility and effectiveness
of sperm and semen motility. I used it for the past few months,
and not only does it work - I also feel better to. I have 
more energy. This is an excellent counter to low sperm count
and motility. I'll be buying more!!!"
Franz K., Bonn, Germany

"I had been wondering on the causes of low semen and 
sperm count, I was searching for this type of information 
when I found your site. I hadn't been made aware of this 
product before then, so was quite surprised to be able 
to find a Male fertility product. Usually everything is 
geared towards female fertility. Suffice to say I ordered 
and a few months later we received the good news from the 
Doctors - My wife is pregnant. I can't be 100% sure if 
it was Spur-M that helped. But I am happy enough to be able
to say it should be considered by any man looking to increase 
his fertility. It worked for me. Thanks."
