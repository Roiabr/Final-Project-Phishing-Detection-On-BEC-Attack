<p><strong>Panda Software Ranks Famous People Most Often Used to Spread Computer Viruses </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>A coordinated attack with four species of malware featuring an image of<br>

Michael Jackson marks a resurgence in the use of famous names to<br>

distribute malware on the Internet. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The recent distribution of a new type of malware, detected by Panda Software <br>
as Downloader.DBR, by mass mailing messages to users around the world and <br>
using a spoof story about a suicide attempt by Michael Jackson, is nothing more <br>
than a new episode in social engineering: exploiting the popularity of certain celebrities <br>
to increase the propagation of this type of threat. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The strategy used to spread this malware is actually quite complex: the<br>
message, which has been distributed manually as spam across the<br>
Internet, contains a link to web page. This page, by means of an<br>
example of malware detected by Panda Software as Phel.J, exploits a<br>
browser vulnerability to insert Inor.AK, an HTML application, on<br>
computers. This in turn provides the access needed to install<br>
Downloader.DBR on the user's computer. However the malicious chain<br>
doesn't end there. Once installed on computers, this Trojan downloads<br>
the AU variant of the Dedler worm, which actually takes the malicious action on the infected computer.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Michael Jackson has been used as bait<br>
to distribute this kind of threat: last November a mail was distributed<br>
supposedly containing a link to a website from which users could<br>
download a video of Jackson with a child. This video did not exist, but<br>
instead a Trojan was downloaded onto the computer.</p>
<p>Even though it is not usual for such complex coordinated techniques to<br>
be used to install malware on computers, the names of celebrities are<br>
frequently used to distribute mails which either contain malware<br>

attached to the mail itself (often camouflaged as an image), or which<br>

contain a URL where the malware is accessed (as in this case). Trojans<br>
in themselves do not generally have the capacity to propagate (as worms<br>
do), and so this type of strategy is needed for the message to spread.</p>
<p>At the top of this particular &quot;celebrity virus ranking&quot; is Britney Spears, <br>
who, according to data from PandaLabs, has been the involuntary protagonist<br>
of most attacks over the last years. Attractive female celebrities are<br>

often used for these purposes as the excuse for sending the mail is<br>

often to entice users with the promise of interesting photos. Along<br>
these lines, third and fourth respectively in the ranking come Jennifer </p>
<p>Lopez (unfortunately associated to the famous LoveLetter) and Shakira.<br>
Porn stars are also often used for this purpose. </p>
<p>The second person most frequently used by malware creators to<br>
distribute their works is Microsoft owner, Bill Gates, and fifth in the<br>
list is Osama Bin Laden. The latter has been the subject of e-mails<br>

claiming that he has been hung, or finally caught, and the spread of<br>
these messages increased after the Iraq war.</p>

<p>Other famous people who have been used in this context include Anna<br>
Kournikova, who was the subject of a widespread example of malware<br>
bearing her name, Bill Clinton, Pamela Anderson, and even Alberto<br>
Fujimori, the former president of Peru.</p>
<p> The ranking of famous people most frequently used is:</p>

  <li> Britney Spears </li>
