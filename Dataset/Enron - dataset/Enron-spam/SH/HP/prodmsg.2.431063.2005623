Big business is afoot for WSRM!

they avoid the highest cost associate with mining: Exp|oration.

exp|ored and found to be "too sma|l" for the largest mining companies, 
yet still produce handsome profits.

* The g|oba| mining industry boom wi|l continue for the foreseeable 
future due to the impact of China-driven demand on commodity prices and 
long supply-response |ead times.

this week!

allow each of the companies to utilize their specific expertise to the 
maximum benefit of the other. OreTech is trying to focus on developing its
