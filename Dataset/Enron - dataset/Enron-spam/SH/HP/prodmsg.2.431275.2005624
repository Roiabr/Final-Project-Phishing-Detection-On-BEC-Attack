Dear,
 
I am George Williams, a consulting auditor,NedBank Plc, 
Johannesburg-South Africa.During the course of my auditing work with my c=
lient
bank, I discovered an account worth $25,400.000.00USD opened in the bank
in 1998 by a great late Estate Magnate who died without a written or oral=

'WILL' attached to the account with respect to his investment in Habitat
Real Estate Company South Africa.[Flight AF4590]
([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm)
 

It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate an=
y
of Late Mr. Andreas Schranner next of kin known to the bank, according to=

the immigration data available to the bank,that the Management, under the=

influence of our Chairman and Members of the Board of Directors,started a=
rrangement
for the fund to be decleared "Unclaimed" and subsequentlly be donated as
trust fund for arms/ ammunition to further enhance the course of War in A=
frica
for their selfish political interest/investment.

In order to avert this negative development, I have secretly discussed th=
is
matter with a close confidant attorney whom I must involve in order to as=
sist
us produce legal back-up documents which would substantiate claims/positi=
on
of next of kin and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer o=
f
the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate.I co=
ntacted
you to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the
transfer and also stand in as distant next of kin to the deceased.

All validating and authenticating documents to enable you get this fund w=
ill
be carefully worked out. We have secured from the probate 
registry, an order of Mandamus to locate any of the deceased
beneficiaries, and makes this business 100% Risk Free and legal. The 
sharing ratio after completion of transfer will be thus: 60% for me, 
35% for you,and 5% to cover any expenses that may be incurred in the 
course of completing the transfer.

Kindly indicate your interest to enable us,with your assistance,move the
fund to the banks offshore clearing houses in Europe or Asia. Please note=

that for the purposes of confidentiality, all further 
correspondence should be through my alternative email: georgew205@yahoo.c=
o.in
 
Accept my warm regards as I await your response. 
 
Sincerely,

Mr. George williams
auditor,NedBank Plc, 
Johannesburg-South Africa.
