  VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 14 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- China

announce that it has launched a mobile email system for the Chinese mobile
phone market. The Company is currently in discussions with one of the
world's largest PC manufacturers to distribute this product bundled with
their systems.

Similar to the North American "Blackberry" technology, this mobile email
system was developed with push-based technology that delivers email to the
recipient's cell phone. The "push" technology means email does not have to
be retrieved, but is automatically delivered.

 CHMS  is expecting to make an acquisition ,  Once this
announcement comes out the street should give applause in the form of upward
movement in the stock price. The stock could trade around  $3.00--$4.00
per
share on this type of news. GET IN NOW!!! You know the old saying, buy on
the
rumor and sell on the news. Once the news is out it is time to get ready for
next valley.

A $1,000 dollar investment could yield a $5,000 dollar profit in
just one trade if you trade out at the top.  CHMS  should be one of the most
profitable stocks to trade this year. In this range the stock has potential
to move
in either direction in bigs wings. This means you should be able to buy at
the
lows and sell at the highs for months to come

YOU COULD MAKE $$$THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS$$$TRADING.  CHMS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

 CHMS  is also on The REG SHO
Threshold list, This means someone is short the stock. Any significant
volume spike
in CHMS  could yield drastic results. If the people that are short have to
cover, they will be buying the shares from you at higher prices. This makes
this
stock a TRIPLE PLAY for profits



For pennies you can participate in a stock that could yield results over
and over again just based on the trading patterns.

If the company is able to
effectuate its business model, WATCH OUT!!! We could see aGREAT STORY IN
THE
MAKING.

GOOD LUCK AND TRADE OUT AT THE TOP!!!!
