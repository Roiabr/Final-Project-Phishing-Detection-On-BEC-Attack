Dear ; Friend,

First, I must apologize if my mode of first contact is not acceptable  to 
you and also solicit your confidence in this transaction; this is by virtue 
of its nature as  being utterly private and top secret. Though I know that a 
transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried My 
Name is Silvia Litana,I am the only dauther of late Mr. and Mrs Fred Nzinga 
Litana who was assisinated in 2002 during a political unrest that engulfed 
my Country Zambia  recently. They where shot to dead my unknown Person(s) 
who where accusing him of funding and sponsoring a factional Political group 
with his money. So in respect of this they came to our House and shot 
everyone dead including  my two younger Siblings by then I was not at  
home,But fortunately my Father did not die instantly that day. It took him  
three Months later after that incident before he finally gave up the ghost.

Before the death of my father, in October 28, 2002, in a private hospital, 
he secretly called me on is bedside and told me that it has the sum of  five 
million, five hundred and thousand United States(USS5,500,000)dollars he 
deposited it in a Finance and Security company here Dakar Senegal. with my 
name as next of kin to the fund. Now, after the recent crisis that burst up 
in my Country I ran to Senegal where my father deposited the fund and seeked 
asylum, that is how I now  went to stay in the United States Refugee Camp. 
So that is where am  currently staying for now. But the problem am 
encoutering now is that when I went to the Financial holding company to 
withdraw the  money. I was made to understand that with my status as a 
refugee I can not be able to clear the fund,but can do so with the help of a 
forieng partner. They  told me that the local law hear does not Permit a 
refugee to operate any business atall, nor transact a fund of such 
magnitude. So please dear, I am pleading, if ou can help me and stand as my 
nominated next-of-kin and withdraw the fund for me (USS5,500,000) to your 
account  in your Coutry and I will be very glad to

Please once can help me with this project, I will offer 15% percent of 
themoney then after I will come over to your Country to start up a new life. 
And also go into any profitable business you will advise me to do. Please 
you can reply me with this alternate email address as it is the  most 
confidential for me at the moment. silvia_litana3@yahoo.com

I will be waiting to hear your favourable response.

Sincerely,
Silvia Litana
