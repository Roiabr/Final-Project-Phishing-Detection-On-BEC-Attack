Dear Sir,

Greetings, I am Mr.Henry Okoye the Account Manager of Late Mr.  Morris Th=
ompson
in Standard Trust Bank Regional Office in Victoria island, here in Lagos.=

However I got your contact through the International web directory.I deci=
ded
to contact you by email because I feel that it is more secured and privat=
e.

Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valu=
ed
USD35,000,000.00 (Thirty Five Million Dollars only)that belongs to one of=

our late Customer who died in a plane crash .During our investigation and=

auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money=

belonging to  Late Mr.  Morris Thompson an American great  industrialist
and a resident of Alaska, who  unfortunately lost his life in the plane 
crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31  2000,inc=
luding
his wife and only daughter. 

You shall read more news about the crash on  visiting this site which I g=
ot
during my  investigation;
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ and http://www.nat=
ivefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html


The fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim=

of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our=

discovery of this development.

The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for
Six years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill=
.It
is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this d=
iscovery
that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this do=
rmant
fund. In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trus=
ted
colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin t=
o
Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your ac=
count
as the beneficiary=B4s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a=
 next
of kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr.  Morris Thompson.

In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in=

this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign a=
ccount
and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time o=
f
transfer since we still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why
we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as=

the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to se=
t
up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty a/c can=

also serve for this purpose.

On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as
gratification for your assisting us, and the remaining 60% will be for me=

and my partners.

What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I hav=
e
in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully accomplish
the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free.

Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positi=
ve
response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your w=
ish.
Find in the attachment of my Family Picture, to proof who I am.

I await your Urgent Responce 

Regrads,

Mr.Henry Okoye
