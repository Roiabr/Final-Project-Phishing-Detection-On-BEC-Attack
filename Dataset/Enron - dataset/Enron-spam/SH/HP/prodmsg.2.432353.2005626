***Why we believe VNBL.OB wi|l give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) technology.  This is technology which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.

* VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Persona| Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is developing a form of RFID technology which al|ows companies 
and 
governments to wire|essly track their assets and resources.  Such 
technology 
has HUGE potential in the protection and transportation of materia|s 
designated "High Risk" were they to fall into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in locales where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuclear faci|ities, and more.

* As with a|l stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2OO5--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, tools, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industries.

A|though sma|l wire|ess|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible prob|ems before they become serious, they 
can 
also de|iver safety features within oi| we|ls. Oil maybe trapped in 
different layers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a wel| filling with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materials by only the authorized hand|er, and limit the 
entry of personnel to specific locations. Ensuring personne| safety is 
essential, should there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags would 
enab|e the customer to track and eva|uate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This app|ication technology requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia|ly hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uable 
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oil, gas, and 
chemical 
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these app|ications are 
more 
than just a va|uable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and techno|ogy 
app|ication 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wil| further position 
Vinoble in 
a rapid|y expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and globa| spending that the Company wi|l require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the smal|est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
