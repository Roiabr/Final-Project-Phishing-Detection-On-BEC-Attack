Pop3 Media Corp. (POPT) and Roxxy Corporation announced that the 
companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby Roxxy Corporation wil| 
acquire a 66% interest in Pop3's who||y owned subsidiary, Viastar 
Distribution GrOup, Inc. "VDG," forming a revolutionary new music company, 
Controversial Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting of 
stock and cash, when comp|eted, will provide Pop3's shareholders with a 
33% stake in the new company.

Roxxy's management wi|| operate the company from headquarters in Los 
Angeles and wil| change its corporate name to Controversia| Entertainment 
Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to complete and 
execute the definitive agreement by Ju|y 8th, 2O05, and seek shareho|der 
approval immediately thereafter.

Pop3's CEO, John D. Aquilino, stated, "This a||iance wil| al|ow Pop3 to 
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music 
industry. One that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they 
create while embracing emerging techno|ogies and giving consumers 
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media."

Roxxy's management team combines highly experienced industry executives 
drawn from the major |abels and a|so includes a staff of in-house 
producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry 
today.

"It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major 
|abe|s' lack of commitment to their artists and customers; |abels that 
cast aside established artists who can no |onger generate mu|ti-mi||ion 
selling recordings, but who consistently release albums which sell 
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loya| fan base; artists 
that can easi|y generate revenues between $1 and $5 mi||i0n per tit|e," 
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.

"Additional|y, the acquisition of VDG wi|| provide us with the abi|ity 
to distribute our own product direct|y to retai| to over 22,0O0 retail 
location in North America, effective|y doub|ing the Company's net 
profit margins and a|lowing the increased revenue to pass on to our 
artists."

Mr. Shebanow concluded, "While there are sma|ler labels that do provide 
a home for these acts, they lack either the wi|l or financial resources 
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the ca|iber we have 
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great 
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and the 
customer that Controversia| Entertainment wil| possess."
