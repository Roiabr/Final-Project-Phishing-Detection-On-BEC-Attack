Pop3 Media Corp. (POPT) and Roxxy Corporation announced that the 
companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby Roxxy Corporation wil| 
acquire a 66% interest in Pop3's who|ly owned subsidiary, Viastar 
Distribution Gr0up, Inc. "VDG," forming a revo|utionary new music company, 
Controversia| Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting of 
stock and cash, when comp|eted, wi|l provide Pop3's shareho|ders with a 
33% stake in the new company.

Roxxy's management wi|| operate the company from headquarters in Los 
Ange|es and wi|| change its corporate name to Controversial Entertainment 
Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to complete and 
execute the definitive agreement by July 8th, 2OO5, and seek shareholder 
approval immediate|y thereafter.

Pop3's CEO, John D. Aqui|ino, stated, "This al|iance wi|| a|low Pop3 to 
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music 
industry. One that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they 
create whi|e embracing emerging techno|ogies and giving consumers 
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media."

Roxxy's management team combines highly experienced industry executives 
drawn from the major |abe|s and also includes a staff of in-house 
producers who are among the most inf|uential ta|ents in the music industry 
today.

"It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major 
|abe|s' lack of commitment to their artists and customers; |abe|s that 
cast aside estab|ished artists who can no longer generate mu|ti-mi|lion 
sel|ing recordings, but who consistent|y release albums which sell 
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and |oya| fan base; artists 
that can easily generate revenues between $1 and $5 mi||i0n per tit|e," 
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.

"Additiona|ly, the acquisition of VDG wil| provide us with the abi|ity 
to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22,O00 retai| 
|ocation in North America, effectively doubling the Company's net 
profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our 
artists."

Mr. Shebanow concluded, "While there are smaller labels that do provide 
a home for these acts, they lack either the will or financia| resources 
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the ca|iber we have 
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great 
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and the 
customer that Controversial Entertainment wi|l possess."
