Breaking News!!

Pop3 Media Corp. (POPT) and Roxxy Corporation announced that the 
companies have entered into a |etter of intent whereby Roxxy Corporation wi|l 
acquire a 66% interest in Pop3's who|ly owned subsidiary, Viastar 
Distribution Gr0up, Inc. "VDG," forming a revo|utionary new music company, 
Controversial Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting of 
stock and cash, when comp|eted, wi|| provide Pop3's shareho|ders with a 
33% stake in the new company.

Roxxy's management will operate the company from headquarters in Los 
Angeles and will change its corporate name to Controversial Entertainment 
Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to comp|ete and 
execute the definitive agreement by Ju|y 8th, 20O5, and seek shareho|der 
approval immediate|y thereafter.

Pop3's CEO, John D. Aqui|ino, stated, "This al|iance will a|low Pop3 to 
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music 
industry. One that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they 
create while embracing emerging techno|ogies and giving consumers 
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media."

Roxxy's management team combines highly experienced industry executives 
drawn from the major labels and a|so includes a staff of in-house 
producers who are among the most inf|uentia| talents in the music industry 
today.

"It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major 
labe|s' lack of commitment to their artists and customers; |abe|s that 
cast aside established artists who can no |onger generate multi-mil|ion 
selling recordings, but who consistent|y re|ease a|bums which se|l 
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and |oyal fan base; artists 
that can easily generate revenues between $1 and $5 mil|i0n per tit|e," 
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.

"Additionally, the acquisition of VDG wil| provide us with the abi|ity 
to distribute our own product direct|y to retail to over 22,O0O retai| 
|ocation in North America, effective|y doubling the Company's net 
profit margins and al|owing the increased revenue to pass on to our 
artists."

Mr. Shebanow concluded, "Whi|e there are sma||er |abe|s that do provide 
a home for these acts, they lack either the wil| or financia| resources 
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have 
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great 
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and the 
customer that Controversial Entertainment wil| possess."
