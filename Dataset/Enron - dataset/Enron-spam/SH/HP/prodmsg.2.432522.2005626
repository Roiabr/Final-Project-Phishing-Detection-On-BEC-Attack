Spring was slow in unfolding. For the last few weeks of Lent it had been
steadily fine and frosty weather. In the daytime there was a thaw in the
sun, but at night there were as many as seven degrees of frost. The snow was
so packed and frozen that loads could be carried along anywhere, regardless
of roads. Easter came in snow. Then all of a sudden, on Easter Monday, a
warm wind sprang up, storm clouds swooped down, and for three days and three
nights the warm, tempestuous rain fell in torrents. On Thursday the wind
dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the land, as though screening the
mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in nature. Behind
the fog there was the flowing of water, the cracking and floating of ice,
the swift rush of turbid, foaming torrents; and on the following Monday, in
the evening, the fog parted, the storm clouds split up into little curling
crests of cloud, the sky cleared, and the real spring had come. In the
morning the sun arose brilliant and quickly wore away the thin layer of ice
that covered the water, and all the warm air was quivering with the steam
that rose up from the quickened earth. The old grass looked greener, and the
young grass thrust up its tiny blades; the buds of the guelder-rose and of
the currant, and the sticky birch buds were swollen with sap, and an
exploring bee was humming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow.
Larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered
stubble land; pewits wailed over the lowlands and marshes, flooded by the
pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering their spring
calls. The cattle, bald in patches where the new hair had not grown yet,
lowed in the pastures; bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating dams,
who were shedding their fleece; nimble-footed children ran along the drying
paths, covered with the prints of bare feet; there was a merry chatter of
peasant women over their linen at the pond, and the ring of axes in the
yard, where the peasants were repairing plows and harrows. The real spring
had come.  as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing
