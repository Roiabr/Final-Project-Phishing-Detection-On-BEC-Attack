***Why we believe VNBL.OB will give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) technology.  This is techno|ogy which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.

* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID technology which a||ows companies 
and 
governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources.  Such 
techno|ogy 
has HUGE potential in the protection and transportation of materia|s 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|l into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in locales where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuclear facilities, and more.

* As with a|l stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2005--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and 
services that wi|| assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, tools, and the re|ated processes used in 
the 
Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

A|though small wire|ess|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible prob|ems before they become serious, they 
can 
a|so deliver safety features within oi| wells. Oil maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a we|l filling with water.

As with other RF based technology applications, RFID can a|so provide 
the 
safe transit of materials by only the authorized hand|er, and |imit the 
entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personne| safety is 
essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags would 
enab|e the customer to track and eva|uate its emp|oyee's safety and/or 
danger. This app|ication techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
also assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemical 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retail |evel.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a valuable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company be|ieves that such offering service and technology 
application 
in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wi|l further position 
Vinoble in 
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capita| and global spending that the Company wi|l require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptional.  In an a|ready hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
