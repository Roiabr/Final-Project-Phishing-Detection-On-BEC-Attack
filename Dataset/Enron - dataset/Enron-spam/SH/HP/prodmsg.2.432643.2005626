Hows it been going?

Do those plumbers always remember jumping?

About happiness There is only one success: to be able to spend your life in your own way, and not to give others absurd maddening claims upon it.	-Christopher Darlington Morley (1890-1957)	

Thanks Alot,

If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing.	W. Edwards Deming	. Do those gardners regret walking carefully?.

9. Lots of times you have to pretend to join a parade in which you're not really interested in order to get where you're going.	-Christopher Darlington Morley (1890-1957)	.

The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.	Alvin Toffler	. THE PARENT arrived back on the scene. She gave me a tape by Dr. Laura Meyers from UCLA. I listened to that tape eight times. I listened over and over and heard the same thing again and again. Ms. Meyers said, 'These kids may need to hear a word many times (perhaps 72 times) before they ever say a word. A computer can be patient and say it the same way every time.' Now I understood. I was not patient enough. I did not allow the student to hear the words over and over. I was interrupting their learning by interjecting, when they were totally engrossed in what they were doing. I was asking questions they were not ready to answer. They were just learning language. They didn't have the answers yet..
