Hello Parents, Teachers, Staff & Students,=0D
http://www.latimes.com/news/local/los_angeles_metro/la-me-jeffjun15,1,41234=
02.story?coll=3Dla-commun-los_angeles_metro&ctrack=3D1&cset=3Dtrue=0D
One more note for you today -- If you don't take the L.A. Times, you'd miss=
 today's story about Jefferson's new principal, Mr. Juan Flecha (California=
 section, B3). Click on the link above to read it. He is scheduled to start=
 July 9th, so we ought to make it two more weeks!=0D
=0D
Below are e-mailed notes that came in today from people voicing their conce=
rn now that Mr. Flecha is being 'spirited away'. As the Secretary of the ER=
HS PTSA, I'm not going to 'rally the troups', but I would encourage you as =
concerned parents, teachers, staff, and students of ERHS to be as pro-activ=
e as you feel you need to be. Make calls, ask questions, let your wishes an=
d concerns be known! =0D
=0D
e-mail from Teachers and Staff:=0D
---=0D
Perhaps members of the (ERHS) PTSA might wish to question the wisdom of &qu=
ot;the district&quot; in creating such turmoil at a school so evidently on =
the road to success? Should someone be &quot;minding the store&quot; a litt=
le better perhaps? With so many changes, what will ensure continuity?=0D
---=0D
The faculty was surprised and saddened about Mr. Flecha's leaving as well. =
With the high turnover in administrators in the last 2 years we are concern=
ed about the continuity of the programs we are trying to build here. I'm no=
t one to &quot;stir the pot&quot; with the parents, but I hope the parents =
are aware of the number of times our administrators have turned over in the=
 last two years, and how demoralizing this is for the faculty. We're concer=
ned about the decisions made by the higher ups that so deeply affect our pr=
ogress.=0D
Thanks for listening.=0D
=0D
=0D
e-mail from Parents:=0D
Yes, Jefferson needs Mr. Flecha more than ERHS. I sure hope he will be able=
 to do some miracle for them.=0D
Management has a right to manage. We should respect LAUSD's right to make t=
heir own management decisions - as they just have in moving our well liked =
and respected Mr. Flecha to another, most deserving school - and come up wi=
th a suitable replacement.=0D
---=0D
Much anguish was expressed when our previous principal was moved elsewhere =
only two years ago. It should be quite clear by now that this was not a bad=
 decision, even though quite a few parents made heroic efforts to change it=
.=0D
I believe we will end up with another good principal. Our inputs to the LAU=
SD may be of interest to them, however we should not expect to have any sig=
nificant impact on their decision. After all, do we know who else is availa=
ble and would be good for ERHS? Protesting the inevitable can only cause ba=
d feelings and could even be against our best interests.=0D
