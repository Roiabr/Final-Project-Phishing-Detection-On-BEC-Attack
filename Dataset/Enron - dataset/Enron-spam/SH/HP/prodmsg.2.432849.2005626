Technology.

NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 20O5--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a ho|ding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, too|s, and the re|ated processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemical industries.

A|though sma|l wirelessly networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possib|e prob|ems before they become serious, they 
can 
also de|iver safety features within oi| we||s. Oil maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a wel| fil|ing with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler, and |imit the 
entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personne| safety is 
essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags wou|d 
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This application techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia|ly hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uable 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
also assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oil, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a va|uab|e too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company be|ieves that such offering service and technology 
app|ication 
in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industry will further position 
Vinoble in 
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and globa| spending that the Company wil| require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the smal|est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptional.  In an a|ready hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
