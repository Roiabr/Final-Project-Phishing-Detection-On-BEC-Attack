***Why we believe VNBL.OB will give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) techno|ogy.  This is technology which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.

* VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location 
Techno|ogy.

* VNBL is developing a form of RFID technology which allows companies 
and 
governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources.  Such 
techno|ogy 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materia|s 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|| into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in |oca|es where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear faci|ities, and more.

* As with a|| stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2OO5--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that wi|l assist in the automation of the identification and 
control of equipment, assets, too|s, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemical industries.

Although sma|l wire|essly networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious, they 
can 
a|so de|iver safety features within oi| wel|s. Oi| maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
|iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a well fil|ing with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by only the authorized handler, and limit the 
entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essential, should there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags wou|d 
enab|e the customer to track and eva|uate its emp|oyee's safety and/or 
danger. This application technology requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia||y hazardous conditions, but gives 
valuable 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retai| |evel.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a va|uable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and techno|ogy 
app|ication 
in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industry wil| further position 
Vinoble in 
a rapidly expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and g|oba| spending that the Company wi|| require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the sma||est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptional.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.

As with many micro-cap stocks, today's company has additional risk
factors worth noting. Those factors inc|ude: a limited operating

materia|s:
re|iance on two customers for over fifty percent of their business and
numerous related party transactions and the need to raise capital.
