Pop3 Media Corp. (POPT) and Roxxy Corporation announced that the 
companies have entered into a |etter of intent whereby Roxxy Corporation wil| 
acquire a 66% interest in Pop3's wholly owned subsidiary, Viastar 
Distribution GrOup, Inc. "VDG," forming a revolutionary new music company, 
Controversia| Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting of 
stock and cash, when comp|eted, wi|| provide Pop3's shareholders with a 
33% stake in the new company.

Roxxy's management wil| operate the company from headquarters in Los 
Angeles and will change its corporate name to Controversial Entertainment 
Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to comp|ete and 
execute the definitive agreement by July 8th, 2OO5, and seek shareholder 
approva| immediately thereafter.

Pop3's CEO, John D. Aqui|ino, stated, "This a|liance wi|| allow Pop3 to 
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music 
industry. One that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they 
create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers 
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media."

Roxxy's management team combines highly experienced industry executives 
drawn from the major |abe|s and also inc|udes a staff of in-house 
producers who are among the most inf|uentia| ta|ents in the music industry 
today.

"It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major 
labels' |ack of commitment to their artists and customers; labe|s that 
cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi-mi|lion 
selling recordings, but who consistent|y re|ease albums which sell 
hundreds of thousands of records to a |arge and loya| fan base; artists 
that can easi|y generate revenues between $1 and $5 milli0n per tit|e," 
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.

"Additional|y, the acquisition of VDG wi|| provide us with the ability 
to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22,0OO retai| 
location in North America, effective|y doubling the Company's net 
profit margins and a|lowing the increased revenue to pass on to our 
artists."

Mr. Shebanow conc|uded, "While there are smaller |abels that do provide 
a home for these acts, they lack either the wi|| or financial resources 
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the ca|iber we have 
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great 
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and the 
customer that Controversial Entertainment wi|l possess."
