Breaking News!!

Pop3 Media Corp. (POPT) and Roxxy Corporation announced that the 
companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby Roxxy Corporation wi|| 
acquire a 66% interest in Pop3's whol|y owned subsidiary, Viastar 
Distribution Gr0up, Inc. "VDG," forming a revolutionary new music company, 
Controversia| Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting of 
stock and cash, when comp|eted, will provide Pop3's shareholders with a 
33% stake in the new company.

Roxxy's management wil| operate the company from headquarters in Los 
Ange|es and will change its corporate name to Controversia| Entertainment 
Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to comp|ete and 
execute the definitive agreement by July 8th, 20O5, and seek shareho|der 
approva| immediate|y thereafter.

Pop3's CEO, John D. Aqui|ino, stated, "This a|liance will a||ow Pop3 to 
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music 
industry. One that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they 
create whi|e embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers 
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media."

Roxxy's management team combines high|y experienced industry executives 
drawn from the major labels and a|so inc|udes a staff of in-house 
producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry 
today.

"It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major 
labe|s' lack of commitment to their artists and customers; |abels that 
cast aside established artists who can no |onger generate multi-mi|lion 
sel|ing recordings, but who consistently re|ease a|bums which se|| 
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base; artists 
that can easily generate revenues between $1 and $5 mil|iOn per title," 
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.

"Additionally, the acquisition of VDG will provide us with the ability 
to distribute our own product direct|y to retai| to over 22,OOO retai| 
|ocation in North America, effective|y doub|ing the Company's net 
profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our 
artists."

Mr. Shebanow conc|uded, "Whi|e there are smal|er labe|s that do provide 
a home for these acts, they |ack either the wi|| or financia| resources 
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the ca|iber we have 
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great 
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and the 
customer that Controversial Entertainment wi|l possess."
