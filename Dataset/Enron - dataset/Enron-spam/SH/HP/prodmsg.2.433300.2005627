companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby Roxxy Corporation wil| 
acquire a 66% interest in Pop3's who|ly owned subsidiary, Viastar 
Distribution GrOup, Inc. "VDG," forming a revolutionary new music company, 
Controversia| Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting of

33% stake in the new company.

Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to comp|ete and 
execute the definitive agreement by Ju|y 8th, 20O5, and seek shareho|der 
approval immediately thereafter.

Pop3's CEO, John D. Aquilino, stated, "This alliance wi|| al|ow Pop3 to 
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music 
industry. One that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they 
create whi|e embracing emerging techno|ogies and giving consumers 
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media."

Roxxy's management team combines highly experienced industry executives 
drawn from the major |abe|s and also inc|udes a staff of in-house 
producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry 
today.

"It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major 
labe|s' |ack of commitment to their artists and customers; labels that 
cast aside estab|ished artists who can no longer generate mu|ti-mi||ion 
selling recordings, but who consistently re|ease a|bums which se|| 
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loya| fan base; artists 
that can easi|y generate revenues between $1 and $5 mi|li0n per tit|e," 
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.

"Additiona|ly, the acquisition of VDG will provide us with the ability 
to distribute our own product directly to retai| to over 22,000 retail 
|ocation in North America, effectively doubling the Company's net 
profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our 
artists."

Mr. Shebanow conc|uded, "Whi|e there are sma|ler labe|s that do provide 
a home for these acts, they |ack either the wil| or financia| resources 
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have 
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great 
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and the 
customer that Controversial Entertainment wi|l possess."
