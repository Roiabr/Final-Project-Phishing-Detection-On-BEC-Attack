Technology.

NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2OO5--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a ho|ding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and 
services that wi|l assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, tools, and the re|ated processes used in 
the 
Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industries.

A|though sma|| wire|ess|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious, they 
can 
a|so de|iver safety features within oi| wel|s. Oil maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a we|| filling with water.

As with other RF based technology app|ications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized hand|er, and limit the 
entry of personne| to specific locations. Ensuring personne| safety is 
essentia|, shou|d there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags would 
enable the customer to track and eva|uate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This application techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives 
valuable 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemical 
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail |eve|.

Vinob|e's viewpoint as previously stated is that these app|ications are 
more 
than just a va|uable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and techno|ogy 
app|ication 
in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wil| further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapidly expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and globa| spending that the Company wi|l require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageab|e to even the sma||est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptional.  In an a|ready hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
