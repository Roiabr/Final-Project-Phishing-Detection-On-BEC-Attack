               The funniest things kids say.

     If we ever need reminders that God is in control, just listen to kids
and their uncomplicated and complete faith.  The first story today shows
how with a very simple answer children can remind us of the essence of
things.

THE FUNNY THINGS KIDS SAY

     Tatum's Grandma Brenda and Grandpa Rube, have a vegetable garden with
tomatoes, squash and peppers.  Tatum was visiting with her parents and
Brenda showed Tatum, 3, one of the home grown tomatoes.  Brenda asked, "Do
you know who grew this?"  Tatum looked at her grandma with big blue eyes
and very seriously replied "God!"  -- Brenda and Ruben Salazar of Grand
Prairie, Texas

     On a recent vacation in Florida the Fred and Cathie Kreigh family went
for a boat ride.  Unfortunately, Fred gets seasick very easily, and that
day was no exception.  Sam, 10, got sick, too.  Feeling miserable, he told
his mom, "God made us all different... so why is it 'like father, like
son?' (with regard to being seasick)"  -- Cathie Kreigh of Kendallville,
Indiana

     Four years ago Angela became mom to her 5-year-old adopted son.  She
is the only mom he has ever known, so they have a special bond.  Every day
before naptime they chat before his naptime song.  He usually asks a
question that pertains to something you have to put in 5-year-old terms to
understand.  One day he asked, "What is your funny bone?  Where is it
located?"  With 20 years of medical expertise, Angela knew this was
something she could explain.  She told him where it is and why God made us
with joints that bend.  After listening very intently, he asked, "Mom, did
God give us any SAD bones?"  -- Angela Jones of Jacksonville, Florida

     Jacob, who lived on a farm, announced in a pre-school Sunday school
class that they had a new baby calf.  Carol asked, "Was is a cow girl or a
cow boy?"  With a look of disbelief, Jacob said flatly, "It's a HEIFER!"
-- Carol Young of Albion, Indiana (the young fellow has since graduated
from high school)

     Molly's children blessed her life through the avenue of adoption.  One
day their son, at the age of 3, was riding his tricycle with a little boy
who lived across the street.  They were riding in the garage on a rainy day
and Molly overheard the boy say, "She's NOT your MOTHER!"  Politely, Molly
told the little boy he had to go home and as she closed the garage door,
she leaned on it and wept.  Then she felt a gentle nudge, and her precious
son said, "Mommy, please don't cry.  He just meant that I didn't grow in
your stomach!"  -- Molly Lemmons of Mustang, Oklahoma

     Diane's 2-year-old grandson Oggie was playing with his 3-year-old
friend Ian.  Ian said, "I'm Spiderman.  What super hero are you?"  Oggie
raised his fist in the air and shouted, "John Deere!" (His Grandpa Jim has
brainwashed him with John Deere T-shirts, hats, toys, etc.!)  -- Diane
Schlemmer of LaGrange, Indiana

     It was a sunny hot day and Sherri had given Lillian, 2, an ice pop to
eat.  It was the kind of frozen treat that is in a plastic tub; you push it
up as you eat.  Lillian knew enough to push up the frozen part to eat it,
but there was a lot of melted "juice" in the bottom so Sherri said, "You
need to hold it up (so the juice could be sipped)."  But little Lillian,
eager to please, held the whole tube up, like the Statue of Liberty!  --
Sherri Winther (babysitter) of Huntington Station, New York

     One evening when her twin boys were 7 they were eating dinner and Ben
announced, "I know what a French kiss is."  Rose glanced at her husband
across the table, trying to retain her composure.  They had always said
they'd speak truthfully with their children, but intimacy was a topic they
had not yet addressed.  Rose took a deep breath and said, "You do?  What is
it?"  Ben announced proudly, "It's when you kiss someone and they give you
a French fry!"  -- Rose Vanden Eynden of Cincinnati, Ohio

     When Pat's granddaughter was in the first grade her mother was a
helper in her school room.  One day she was helping a little boy and he
said to her, "Oh Mrs. Carroll you smell so good."  She said, "Well, thank
you."  The little boy continued, "What is it... bacon or sausage?"  -- Pat
Cook of Lubbock, Texas

     Joyce was staying with her grandchildren while their parents were on a
business trip.  Olivia, 4, got a cold soon after her parents left.  When
Joyce caught it, too, Olivia proudly reported to her grandpa, "I gave it to
Grandma!"  Also, when she was helping to fold laundry, she was upset when
clothes were "insided out."  -- Grandma Joyce of Colorado Springs, Colorado

     Mallory, 3, was driving on country roads after a visit to the lake.  A
very strong skunk odor entered the van and the adults commented on how bad
the skunk smelled.  Mallory spoke up, "Someone should give that skunk a
bath!"  -- Ryan and Dawn Jackson (parents of Mallory) of Kendallville,
Indiana
