Your body can not be very valuable to you if all your time is required to
feed it
I shall, therefore, present you, as my first gift, this box of tablets
<br>
<br>Within each tablet are stored certain elements of electricity which are
capable of nourishing a human body for a full dayAll you need do is to toss
one into your mouth each day and swallow it
