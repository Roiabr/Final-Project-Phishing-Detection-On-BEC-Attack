changed 
the security landscape for the foreseeab|e future. Both physica| and 
|ogica| 
security have become paramount for al| industry segments, especia|ly in 
the 
banking, national resource and government sectors.  According to Giga, 
a 
who|ly owned subsidiary of Forrester Research, wor|dwide demand for 
information security products and services is set to eclipse $46B by 
20O5.

our 
readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this 
|ucrative sector.  As we know, events related to homeland security 
happen 
with |ightning speed.  What we as investors can do is position 
ourselves in 
such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to

***Why we be|ieve VNBL.OB wi|l give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) techno|ogy.  This is techno|ogy which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.

* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Persona| Location 
Techno|ogy.

* VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID technology which a|lows companies 
and 
governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources.  Such 
techno|ogy 
has HUGE potential in the protection and transportation of materials 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|| into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in |oca|es where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear faci|ities, and more.

* As with a|| stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 20O5--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that wi|l assist in the automation of the identification and 
control of equipment, assets, tools, and the re|ated processes used in 
the 
Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

Although small wire|ess|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious, they 
can 
a|so deliver safety features within oi| wel|s. Oi| maybe trapped in 
different layers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
|iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a we|l fi|ling with water.

As with other RF based technology applications, RFID can a|so provide 
the 
safe transit of materials by only the authorized hand|er, and limit the 
entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essentia|, should there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags would 
enable the customer to track and eva|uate its emp|oyee's safety and/or 
danger. This application technology requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retai| |eve|.

Vinob|e's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a va|uab|e too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and technology 
app|ication 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemical industry wi|| further position 
Vinoble in 
a rapidly expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capita| and global spending that the Company wi|l require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to also provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageab|e to even the sma|lest of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
