      <P>Money Matters is no ordinary investment newsletter. It is 
      written by top investment professionals including technical analysts=
, 
		broker and traders.</P>
      <P>Twice each month, this glossy, professionally-produced newsletter=
 gives 
      our readers the inside scoop on <B>trends, momentums, news, insights=
 and 
      analyses </B>on selected equities -- from both regional and global 
		markets. Alan Roth of Phoenix Growth Fund says, - Money Matters turns a =

		mountain of data into four pages of common sense.</P>
      <P>But, of the six issues you're invited to receive, there's one tha=
t our 
      readers anticipate the most. That's our famous <b>- Quarterly 
      Recommendation -</b> issue, which profiles a company we predict will=
 be a 
      considerable stock market gainer.</P>
      <P>Imagine... some of the world's leading financial commentators put=
ting 
      their reputation on the line to tell you exactly which stock to buy,=
 when 
      to buy it, and when to sell. No wonder Mark Hrbek, author of <I>Doll=
ars 
      and Sense</I> and <I>The Investor's Guide to Profits</I> says, - I f=
ound 
		Money Matters surprisingly candid, not afraid to make a call...</P>
      <P>Just how insightful is Money Matters? Take a look at our previous=
 
      quarterly recommendations and judge for yourself. </P>
