<!-- finished 'Stones' today. The ending leaves me with as many questions a=
s answers. I am curious to know if there is a forum available to discuss in=
terpretations of exactly what happened at the end. Did Dawes die literally =
or figuratively? This may be obvious to some but isn't clear to me. I am al=
so not sure if the end 'catches up' in time to the scenes with Dawes and Ur=
zika earlier in the book. I am surprised that no other questions of this na=
ture appear on this board. Thanks for bringing the book to my attention. * =

much for your perspective. The main reason why I questioned the 'real' deat=
h of Dawes at the end of the book was my initial inability to reconcile whe=
re Book/Chapter 3.1 (Dawes' first scenes with Urzika) took place in time. I=
t was unclear to me where the Urzika thread picked up after his period of i=
nstitutionalization and scene on the Mexican train. I have since re-read Bo=
ok 3 and realize that section 3.5 picks up where 3.1 left off and Dawes tim=
e with Urzika is chronological. So, I now agree with your assessment of Daw=
es' death being real, though I am a little curious as to the physical cause=
 of it - alcohol poisoning or complications from his infected eye or some o=
f both. Congratulations for discovering this book back when it was publishe=
