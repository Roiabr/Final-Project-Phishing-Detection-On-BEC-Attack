          <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
            My name is <span lang="en-us">Charles Davis</span>. I was made 
            redundant from my job in <span lang="en-us">June </span>of 200<span lang="en-
us">3</span>, 
            along with several other employees at the printing firm where I 
            worked. At that time I was living beyond my means and in serious 
            debt. Several debt collectors were hounding me on an almost daily 
            basis, and this consequently started a chain reaction that ended 
            with the repossession of my car and then my home. As you can 
            probably imagine, my prospects looked pretty bleak.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Then, in March 
            of 200<span lang="en-us">4</span>, I received a short and simple 
            email telling me how to make over $15,000<span lang="en-us"> </span>
            at a time. I ignored it because of course, I was skeptical. However, 
            I didn't delete that email because something about it rang true to 
            me, and I was desperate to know whether it was possible to make that 
            amount of money in such a short space of time. I finally realized 
            that I had absolutely nothing to lose by having a go at the plan 
            offered to me in that email. And apart from that, I just couldn’t 
            stop myself from thinking “What if it actually works?”<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, I put my doubts to one side and I went ahead and followed 
            the simple instructions given in that email. It took me less than 30 
            minutes to complete and it cost me no more than $<span lang="en-us">4.50
            </span>.<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;And yet, by the end of 200<span lang="en-
us">4</span>, 
            I was able to book the family holiday of a lifetime in Miami, and I 
            bought a brand new Audi A8 with hard cash. And in the autumn of 200<span lang="en-
us">4</span>, 
            I purchased a tidy semi-detached home for no less than $125,000. And 
            yet, I don’t owe a single penny to anyone!</font></p>

            <font color="#ff0000"><b>To date, I have made exactly $392,718. My

            predicts that, within the next 24 months, I will become a 
            millionaire just through this one business alone. Even now as I 
            write this, I find it strange to come to terms with the fact that, 
            like most people, I’ve worked hard and <b>struggled all my life just 
            to ‘get by’ </b>and then something ridiculously simple drops into my 
            lap and immediately turns my life around completely. When I think 
            back to all the similar emails I had previously deleted, it makes me 
            shudder, because now I know just how close I came to missing out 
            completely.<br>

                    out your email to 40 different people. You can expect at 
                    least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 
                    40 = 5). By this time, your email address will have moved up 
                    to <b>Number 4</b> in the list, and this list will now have 
                    reached around 200 people (5 x 40).<br>
                    <br>
                    Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them 
                    to respond (12.5% of 200), so that's a further 1,000 emails 
                    (25 x 40) being sent out with you now at the <b>Number 3</b> 
                    position.<br>
                    <br>
                    Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of 
                    them to respond (12.5% of 1,000), so that's a further 5,000 
                    emails (125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the <b>
                    Number 2</b> position.<br>
                    <br>
                    Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of 
                    them to respond (12.5% of 5,000), so that's 25,000 emails 
                    (625 x 40) being sent out with you at the <b>Number 1</b> 
                    spot!<br>
                    <br>
                    Out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of 
                    them to respond<br>
                    (12.5% of 25,000). <font color="#000000">Since you will now

            Over the course of 30 days, this money will be sent to you by a few 
            thousand people just like yourself - who are willing to invest half 
            an hour to receive around $15,000 in cash! This is real money that 
            you can spend on anything you wish! Just deposit it to your own bank 
            account or spend it directly from your Paypal account!!! It really 
            is that easy!<br>
            <br>
            But there's more!!! For each person who signs up with Paypal as a 
            result of using YOUR unique referral URL, <b>you will automatically 
            receive a referral bonus of up to $75 from Paypal!</b><br>
            <br>
            Remember, the 12.5% example above is assuming that 35 out of the 40 
            people you send your email to will do absolutely nothing except 
            delete your email. Additionally, the above example assumes that each 
            participant will only send out 40 emails. Imagine what would happen 
            if each participant sent out 1,000 emails instead of just 40! 
            Believe me, many people will do this and much more!<br>
            <br>
            Only the first person on the list gets your $4.50 <span lang="en-us">
            payment</span>, but everyone in the list will rise to that Number 1 
            position as thousands of emails are being sent out. No cheating can 
            occur (don't be fooled by claims that this system can be cheated) as 
            Paypal only allows <u>one</u> account per person. Because it is so 
            ridiculously easy, the response rate is VERY HIGH and VERY FAST - 
            You will start seeing dramatic results in less than one week! Just 
            in time for next month's bills!<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            This program is structured for everyone to send only 40 emails each 
            to start. However, you are certainly not limited to 40. Send out as 
            many emails as you want. Every 40 emails you send has a return of at 
            least $1<span lang="en-us">5</span>,000 within 30 days. So, if you 
            can email 50, or 100, or whatever, GO FOR IT! The more you put into 
            it.... the more you get out!<br>
            <br>
            A word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to 
            position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! 
            If you do that, you'll ONLY reach the people you directly send 
            emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from 
            the Number 1 place and you won't reach thousands of people! But, if 
            you add your name to the Number 5 position, there will be literally 
            tens of thousands of people receiving and sending emails later - 
            when your name is at the Number 1 spot!!! So please, play by the 
            rules and the serious money will come to you! This program doesn't 
            cost anything but $4.50 and about half an hour of your time, and if 
            everyone plays fair, everyone WINS!!<br>
            <br>
            So there it is. You now have the knowledge that will enable you to 
            make over $15,000<span lang="en-us"> </span>within the next few 
            weeks. The only thing that can hold you back now is a lack of faith 
            or a lack of self-belief. However, any doubts you may currently have 
            will disappear within a few days of putting this plan into practice. 
            Trust me on this! You certainly won't regret it.<br>
