Hello,

I was hoping you could help me.  The link above takes you to
several
facility & stadium tours created by Virtually Anywhere
Interactive.  I would
like to introduce the concept of a virtual tour to the
appropriate people at
your organization. (Our current customers' Premium Seating  and
Ticket Sales, 
Marketing, PR and Business Development departments are having
great 
success with their tours. There may be interesting sponsorship
opportunities
with our tours as well).

Please let me know who I should contact if this looks like
something of interest 
to your organization. 

Many thanks,

David

P.S. You may have seen us at the ALSD show in Houston (last
year). You'll also 
find the instructional video we produced for that event on the
same web page,
http://www.virtually-anywhere.com/sports/ .
