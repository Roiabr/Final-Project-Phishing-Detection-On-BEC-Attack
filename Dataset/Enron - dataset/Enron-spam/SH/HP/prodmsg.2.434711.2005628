I recently visited www.clothingplus.fi/ and wanted to offer my services.
We could help you with your Wearable Electronics website.

We create websites that mean business for you! Here's the best part,
after we recreate your site in the initial setup, we give you a
user-friendly master control panel. You now have the ability to easily
add or remove copy, text, pictures, products, prices, etc. When YOU want
to!

I would be happy to contact you and brainstorm some ideas.

Regards
-Jason
