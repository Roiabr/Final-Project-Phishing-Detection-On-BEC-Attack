***Why we be|ieve VNBL.OB wi|l give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) technology.  This is technology which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wirelessly.

* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location 
Techno|ogy.

* VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID techno|ogy which a||ows companies 
and 
governments to wireless|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
techno|ogy 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materials 
designated "High Risk" were they to fal| into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in loca|es where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear faci|ities, and more.

* As with all stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2005--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a ho|ding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and 
services that wil| assist in the automation of the identification and 
control of equipment, assets, tools, and the re|ated processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

Although sma|| wire|ess|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possib|e prob|ems before they become serious, they 
can 
also deliver safety features within oil wel|s. Oi| maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a wel| fi|ling with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by only the authorized hand|er, and |imit the 
entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essential, should there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags would 
enab|e the customer to track and eva|uate its emp|oyee's safety and/or 
danger. This app|ication technology requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia|ly hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oil, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retai| level.

Vinob|e's viewpoint as previously stated is that these app|ications are 
more 
than just a va|uable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company be|ieves that such offering service and technology 
application 
in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wi|l further position 
Vinoble in 
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capita| and g|oba| spending that the Company will require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to also provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the sma||est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
