CONFERENCE OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------

CISSE 05 provides a virtual forum for presentation and discussion of the 
state-of the-art research on computers, information and systems sciences and 
engineering. The virtual conference will be conducted through the Internet
using web-conferencing tools, made available by the conference.
Authors will be presenting their PowerPoint, audio or video presentations 
using web-conferencing tools without the need for travel. Conference 
sessions will be broadcast to all the conference participants, where session 
participants can interact with the presenter during the presentation and 
(or) during the Q&A slot that follows the presentation.

This international conference will be held entirely on-line. The accepted and 
presented papers will be made available after the conference both on a CD and 
as a book publication.

Conference participants - authors, presenters and attendees -  only need an 
internet connection and sound available on their computers in order to be 
able to contribute and participate in this international ground-breaking 
conference.

The on-line structure of this high-quality event will allow academic 
professionals and industry participants to contribute work and attend 
world-class technical presentations based on rigorously refereed 
submissions, live, without the need for investing significant travel funds 
or time out of the office.

Potential non-author conference attendees who cannot make the on-line 
conference dates are encouraged to register, as the entire joint conferences 
will be archived for future viewing.
