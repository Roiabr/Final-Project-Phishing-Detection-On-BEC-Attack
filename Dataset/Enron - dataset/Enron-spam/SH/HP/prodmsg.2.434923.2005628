      <p>&quot;I have also created a very elaborate spreadsheet where I am tracking my activities. I keep one page which tracks my trading history. This is only for trades which have completed from start to finish. To date, I have completed 19 trades for an overall profit of $15,925.00, at an average 77 percent ROI. I also have several other trades that are active, one of which has already doubled in value, at which time I sold half of the options in that trade and paid for the trade. It is now a 'free' trade. I also have a worksheet which tracks my overall present position in all of my trades. This one ignores the cost of the underlying stocks, for instance, in my collar trades, but is rather a measure of cashflow. My current YTD total is over $33k...&quot;<br>
        <em><strong>-Bob Hendricks (July 2004)</strong></em></p>      <p>&quot;I have been trading since October of 2002. I started with $14,000 and within 1 year my portfolio is worth over $180,000. Spread trade strategies are simple and easy to understand. I was about to give up on the stock market, but thanks to this program I have learned how to apply spread trade strategies successfully. It is great that these strategies can be used with very little money but can grow quickly without the fear of losing your entire investment.&quot;<br>
        <em><strong>-Ruben P. (2003, To date has a portfolio valued over 400K)</strong></em></p>
      <p> &quot;Keeping a close eye on Netflix over the last couple of months I sold long term short puts out of the money when the stock indicated oversold conditions. As the stock bounced back and showed over bought signals I offloaded the puts and sold calls against my stock. Last month Netflix options alone made me over $3,000. Opening up the Wealthbuilder a few weeks ago I saw a recommendation for a call calendar. At the time I wanted to enter a credit trade instead of a debit trade and entered a bear call based on technical indicators. All options expired worthless and I pocketed the entire credit. This month I placed some covered calls and bull puts on Taser as it rocketed up. I closed all positions after 10 days with a $1500 profit. Many companies proudly advertise big percentage gains. Many times I've asked those companies if those big gains hide big losses - all with the exception of STS was hiding big losing trades. My record this year is 14 out of the 18 stocks I've traded have made money. It's not the 49 out of 50 that Fasi and Greg get but with each month I refine my system and keep closing the gap. The education STS provides is invaluable. Without it my approach would have been that of a gambler. With it my approach is systematic and disciplined and consistently profitable.&quot;<br>
