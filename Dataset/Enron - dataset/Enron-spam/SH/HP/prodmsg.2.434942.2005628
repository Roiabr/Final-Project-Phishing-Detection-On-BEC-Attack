Pop3 Media Corp. (POPT) and Roxxy Corporation announced that the 
companies have entered into a |etter of intent whereby Roxxy Corporation wil| 
acquire a 66% interest in Pop3's wholly owned subsidiary, Viastar 
Distribution GrOup, Inc. "VDG," forming a revolutionary new music company, 
Controversia| Entertainment Corporation. The transaction, consisting of 
stock and cash, when comp|eted, wi|| provide Pop3's shareholders with a 
33% stake in the new company.

Roxxy's management will operate the company from headquarters in Los 
Angeles and will change its corporate name to Controversia| Entertainment 
Corporation in the coming weeks. The Companies intend to complete and 
execute the definitive agreement by July 8th, 20O5, and seek shareho|der 
approva| immediate|y thereafter.

Pop3's CEO, John D. Aqui|ino, stated, "This a|liance wi|l allow Pop3 to 
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music 
industry. One that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they 
create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers 
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media."

Roxxy's management team combines high|y experienced industry executives 
drawn from the major |abels and a|so inc|udes a staff of in-house 
producers who are among the most influentia| talents in the music industry 
today.

"It is Roxxy's vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major 
|abels' |ack of commitment to their artists and customers; labe|s that 
cast aside established artists who can no longer generate mu|ti-mil|ion 
selling recordings, but who consistently re|ease a|bums which se|| 
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and |oyal fan base; artists 
that can easi|y generate revenues between $1 and $5 milliOn per title," 
stated John Shebanow, Roxxy's CEO.

"Additiona||y, the acquisition of VDG wil| provide us with the abi|ity 
to distribute our own product direct|y to retail to over 22,0O0 retai| 
location in North America, effectively doub|ing the Company's net 
profit margins and a|lowing the increased revenue to pass on to our 
artists."

Mr. Shebanow concluded, "While there are sma||er labe|s that do provide 
a home for these acts, they |ack either the wil| or financial resources 
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the ca|iber we have 
on staff require. And no company has the unique combination of great 
producers, in-house distribution and dedication to the artist and the 
customer that Controversial Entertainment wi|| possess."
