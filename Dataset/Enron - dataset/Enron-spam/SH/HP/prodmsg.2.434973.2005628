ATTEN: 
       SEEKING FOR FINANCIAL INVESTMENT INFORMATION 
 
Zimbabwe formerly Rhodesia under the colonial rule
gained independence in 1981 under the nationalist
struggle for independence led by Mr. Robert Mugabe and
late Joshua Nkomo. Under the white rule and since
independence the minority whites that owned most of
the farmlands in Zimbabwe have dominated agriculture.
The aborigines believe that they are still slaves in
their own land if they continue to work the lands for
their whites masters even after independence. Robert
Mugabe as the black Moses who led his people to
freedom has vowed to revoke ownership of the white
owned farms and redistribute the lands to the landless
blacks. This move he said is necessary to redress the
imbalance of the colonial era. For the struggle for
freedom, to affect this initiative the government has
amended its land acquisition laws and policies last
few months, which gave about 3000 white Zimbabwean
farmers a 45-day quit notice to leave their lands to
the government. 

My family and I are caught up in this web of land
politics, which also led to the death of our father.
We have seen reforms after reforms by the government
of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in
shambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough
for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to
relocate our farm to Swaziland, a neighbouring
country, where we have acquired lands. Our capital
base is in South Africa where we are temporarily
living pending such time logistics would be ready for
full-scale operation in Swaziland. Bearing in mind
that Mr. Thabo Mbeki (South African president) and his
government are playing Russian roulette over the
Zimbabwean land crisis, every effort has begun in
earnest to move our capital base to a stable country
where it can be safer. 
 
With a capital base of US$25.5Million, there is a
great deal of secrecy involved to avoid the piercing
eyes and smelling noses of both the governments of
Zimbabwe and South Africa. We are therefore contacting
you so you can use a magnificent business technique to
transfer this financial treasure out of South Africa.
This money is presently deposited confidentially with
A security Company here in South Africa. We mapped out
25% of the gross sum as due commission for your
expected honest assistance in executing the successful
transfer of this money out of South Africa, for our
family investments.
 
Please, call us or email us immediately if you are
interested, so we can discuss further while we hold
this correspondence in the strictest confidence. 
 
Thanks and God bless you. 
Yours truly, 
Evan Smith






REJOYCE
