Greetings to you,

How are you today and business in your country? I am Mr. Xiao Wong, 
Bank Manager of a bank in China. I would respectfully request that you 
keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity 
of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted 
you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this 
communication.I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I 
believe would be of interest to you. I know you would be wondering why 
I am writing you with a request such as this but I only urge you to 
read on.

In November 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese 
Solid Minerals Corporation, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for 
twelve calendar months, valued at some millions of United states 
dollars in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to 
his forwarding address in America and Britain but got no reply. After 
a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his 
contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation contractor 
died alongside his wife,from an airplane crash. The bank immediately 
launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert 
about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If 
you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our 
services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment 
from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next 
of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us 
means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held 
under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts 
anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having 
their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that 
there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they 
nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not 
nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our 
care, in this case; the British Oil consultant/contractor died 
interstate.

In line with our internal processes for account holders who have 
passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to 
determine who should have right to claim the estate. This 
investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned 
every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies 
to get to the root of the problem. This money has since been sitting 
in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal 
sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim 
it. According to the Laws of Republic of China, at the expiration of 6 
(six)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Chinese 
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. What I wish to relate 
to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand 
something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the 
internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of 
banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy 
certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun 
by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There 
is a large sum of money deposited in my bank, I alone have the deposit 
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of 
relationship with the deceased, which I shall provide you with, is 
presented. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as 
my Bank is concerned, the bank's management has no single idea of what?
s the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting 
instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. 

This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money 
trying to track this man's family; they have investigated for months 
and have found no family.The investigation has come to an end. 
Consequently, my proposal is thatI will like you as a foreigner to 
stand in as the next of kin to the deceased so that the fruits of this 
old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt 
government officials. Acting in this capacity really is simple, all 
you have to do is provide your full names and address so that an 
attorney here can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that 
will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services 
of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain 
the necessary authentication, approval and a letter of 
probate/administration in your favour for the transfer to be done. A 
bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with 
will then facilitate the transferof this money to you as the 
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for 
us to share 80/20.

I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you 
find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I 
ask that do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no 
appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do 
not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You 
may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out 
of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am 
not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, 
this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my 
industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come 
ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for 
once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance 
and i wont let it pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, 
if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my 
life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an 
opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities. There is a 
reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I 
have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you 
refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.

There is no risk whatsoever as all the paperwork for this transaction 
will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager 
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are 
interested in this lucrative role, I urge you to indicate to that 
effect. Upon your response, if favourable, I shall provide you with 
more details and relevant information that will help you get full 
understanding of the transaction. If you find yourself able to work 
with me, contact me through this email address. If you give me 
positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I 
wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I 
will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want 
you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you 
contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only 
through the numbers I will provide for you and also through the email 
address I have provided. My official lines are not secure lines as 
they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care 
in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this 
instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have 
a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of 
fear as to what the consequences may be, but I know within me that 
nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never 
come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. 
If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting soon.

In closing, please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured 
that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. Upon 
receiving your reply, I will then furnish you with a more 
comprehensive detail of this transaction, the amount involved and what 
is required of you in order for us to achieve the success of this 
business.

Awaiting your urgent reply. 

Yours Sincerely,

Xiao Wong.
