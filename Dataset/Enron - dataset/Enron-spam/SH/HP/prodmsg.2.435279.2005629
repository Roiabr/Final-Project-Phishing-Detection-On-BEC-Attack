Testimonial from Larry L. I initially started collecting judgments after
being laid off from my job as a bank auditor. From my previous job
experience, I knew what judgments were, however I had no idea of the
tremendous business they would provide me with. As I write this letter to
you, I have just collected another judgment, with my fee being 1,976.28. Not
bad at all for about 15 hours of work. So far this month, I have collected 4
judgments and have earned just over $6,000.  Thanks for helping me get
involved in this business. 


It's no use stopping here, remarked Rob, regretfully, for I've spoiled my
welcome by this accident. I think these people are Irish, by their looks and
speech, so I must be somewhere in the Emerald Isle
