Hello Lisa,
Thank you for sending those invoices to me.  I have not received them 
previously.  I have cut a check for $79.90 and put it in the mail 
today.  I am not certain why I didn't receive them before, but I will 
try to keep a closer eye on this.

Thank you for letting me know of our delinquency.
