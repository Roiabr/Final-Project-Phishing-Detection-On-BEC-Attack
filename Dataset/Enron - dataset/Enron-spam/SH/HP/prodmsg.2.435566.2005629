Re: Investment Cooperation.

I write to introduce some business venture to you, after I have gotten
your contact information on an International Business Directory. I
believe the venture in mind would be profitable to you if the necessary
understanding is achieved between us.

I am a business development specialist, and I represent some investors,
who want to go into the business of purchasing materials in your
country, for further export in Asia. Materials to be purchased would
range from Medical Products, through Textile and Constructions Equipments,
and possible Real Estate Investments would be considered. We therefore
would need a partner in your region who would guide us through the
necessary markets, and partner with us in the establishment of such
venture.

I would on this basis like to know if you would be interested in a
partnership with us, under the following terms:

1. The start-up capital amounts to Twenty Five Million American
Dollars.

2. The start-up amount is in cash and must be transferred in this same
state.

3. You shall be paid a commission of ten percent of the start-up amount
as soon as we are able to establish a proper partnership and
relationship with you.

4. The investors require for their personality and the investment to be
handled professionally and confidentially.

My request thus is for you to cooperate with me in the establishment of
a corporation in your country, through which the venture would be
established.

Let me know if you would be able to cooperate with me in this manner.

I anticipate your response.

Yours Sincerely.

Hamdi Al Ruufaru.
Joint Manager,
HST Associates.
