Testimonial from Dave F., in Nebraska; First of all, I want to tell you
that I am going to be my own first customer. I won a judgment against a man,
but he closed his shop, took my property and disappeared. Thanks to the
information you gave me, I found him THREE DAYS AFTER RECEIVING YOUR
TRAINING MANUAL. I will use the knowledge gained from you to collect what he
owes me. Thank you again. As far as I'm concerned, your training course has
more than paid for itself already.


Silently he stole to the foot of the attic stairs and then paused to
listen. The house seemed very quiet, but he could hear his mother's voice
softly humming a cradle-song that she had sung to him when he was a baby
He had been nervous and unsettled and a little fearful until then, but
perhaps the sound of his mother's voice gave him courage, for he boldly
ascended the stairs and entered the workshop, closing and locking the door
behind him
