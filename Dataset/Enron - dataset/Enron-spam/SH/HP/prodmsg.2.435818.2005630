Letter from David Wood (London)

Greetings,

I am David Wood the Bank Manager of CITIBANK 332 Oxford Street, London W1=
N
9AA. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On=

June 6, 1997, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the BRITISH=

PETROLUEM CORPORATION MR. HAFFEZ AL SADIQUE. 

Made a numbered time (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US=
$20,500,000.00
(Twenty Nine Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my branch. Up=
on
maturity in 2000, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address=

but got no reply. 

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his cont=
ract
employers, the British petroleum corporation that Mr. HAFFEZ AL SADIQUE
died as a result of torture in the hand of Sadam Hussein during one of hi=
s
trips to his country Iraq. On further investigation,

I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace=

his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and=

discovered that MR HAFFEZ AL SADIQUE. Did not declare any kin or relation=
s
in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my=

Bank. 

This sum of US$29,500,000.00 have been floating as unclaimed since 2000
in my bank as all efforts to get his relatives have hit the stones.

According to the British law at the expiration of 8 (eight) years, the mo=
ney
will revert to the ownership of the British  Government if nobody applies=

to claim the fund and the eight years is  the end of December 2004. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I want to seek your consent as a foreig=
ner
to stand in as the owner of the money as the next of kin to the deceased
so that the bank will transfer the money to your designated account. All
documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked=

out. I have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any
of the deceased beneficiaries, and more so I are assuring you that the bu=
siness
is risk free involvement. Your share stays while the rest be for me and
for investment purpose as I will leave London by the end of the year.  

The sharing of the funds will be based According to agreement within me
and you. As soon as I receive an acknowledgement of receipt of this messa=
ge
in acceptance of our mutual business proposal, I will furnish you with th=
e
necessary modalities and disbursement ratio to suit both parties without
any conflict. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue ad=
vantage
of the trust I have bestowed in you.

PLEASE, APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT DOING BUSINESS OVER THE INTERNET IS RISK=
.
ENDEAVOR TO SEND YOUR CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER IN YOUR REPLY=

TO THIS BUSINESS. 

God Bless you. 

MR DAVID WOOD
