Greetings,
I am Prince Fayad W. Bolkiah, the eldest son of Prince Jefri Bolkiah,former =
Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the northern coast =
of the island of Borneo, in eastern Asia.I will save your time by not =
amplifying my extended royal family history,which has already been =
disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that =
erupted between my father and his step brother,the sultan of Brunei Sheik =
Muda Hassanal Bolkiah.

As you may know from the international media,the sultan had accused my father =
of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billion dollars. This =
was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my father company =
Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment Company to =
be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office.However my father was kept =
under house arrest, his bank accounts and private properties including a =
crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the sultanate.

Furthermore, during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my =
immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the =
sultan and his security operatives, but before I could do that I was placed =
under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a phone but I have a =
Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending you this mail.Before my =
Incaceration, I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Fifty Eight Million Five =
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars US$58.5 Million in cash under special =
arrangement into the custody of a Private security and Trustee company for =
safe keeping abroad.

Hence I seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable =
investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family =
abroad.I have decided to offer 10% of these funds to you as compensation for =
your strong cooperation.

Please I count on your absolute confidentiality,transparency and trust while =
looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of this =
business transaction.

I remain yours sincerely.

Prince Fayad .W. Bolkiah
Brunei Darussalam.
