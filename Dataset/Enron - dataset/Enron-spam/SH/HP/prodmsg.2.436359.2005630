Hello,

My name is Shane Lamotte and I'm in the New Rock 
Band Living Illusion. How are you? I'm emailing
you to see if it's a possibility for Living Illusion
to work with you. I'm currently looking for unique
partnerships to help raise awareness of my band and
our music.

If you want to check out my band 
and listen to some tunes go to:
http://www.livingillusion.com/

Please email me back and let me know if you're
interested in finding some way that we can help
support each other in a win/win way.

Thanks,
Shane Lamotte

PS Also if your interested in exchanging Links
between my website and yours just let me know and
we'll make it happen :)
