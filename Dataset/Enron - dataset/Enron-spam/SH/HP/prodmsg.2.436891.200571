                  <h4>Overview</h4>
                  
                  <p>Global Diversified Industries operates in the modular 
                  building construction industry, and strategically targets the 
                  California Education Sector. GDVI is strategically located in 
                  Central California on 16 acres with a 100,000 square foot 
                  state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. </p>
                  <p>Throughout 2003 the company focused on building its 
                  infrastructure through acquisitions, development of a 
                  state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, and by securing the 
                  requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth. </p>
                  <p>Through the combination of its new facility, the increased 
                  demand for portable buildings and the State Of California's 
                  bond approvals, GDVI has become well positioned to become one 
                  of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west 
                  coast. </p>
                  <p>GDVI should benefit greatly from the $12.1 Billion school 
                  improvement bond that is expected to be passed by California 
                  voters next month (March). This presents, in our opinion an 
                  opportunity for early investors of GDVI to also benefit before 
                  the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and 
                  subsequently invests in those companies. </p>
                  <p>Global Diversified has taken numerous strategic development 
                  steps throughout 2003, including generating strong revenues as 
                  well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in 
                  2004. The company is led by a strong management team with 
                  previous success in building companies into $50 million per 
                  annum businesses. </p>
                  <p>In the past year GDVI has exceeded its own sales revenue 
                  projections, renewed its piggyback contract, received state 
                  approvals on engineered product designs, started a new credit 
                  facility and opened its new 100,000 square foot manufacturing 
                  facility. The company will continue to seek new acquisition 
                  candidates through its aggressive growth plan. </p>

                  <h4>Profile</h4>
                  </font>
                  <p>GDVI is a holding company that currently operates three 
                  wholly owned subsidiaries, Lutrex Enterprises, Inc., an entity 
                  which holds equipment and inventory for the registrant, MBS 
                  Construction Inc., a modular contractor specializing in 
                  modular construction site work and renovation and Global 
                  Modular, Inc., a sales, marketing and manufacturing of modular 
                  type structures. </p>
                  <p>Its principal customer base is currently educational 
                  (public and private schools, universities, etc.), child-care 
                  and municipality sectors. Its product lines consist of a 
                  variety of portable classroom designs, including both 
                  single-story and two- story floor plans. Global Modular's 
                  portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed 
                  in accordance with pre-approved building plans, commonly 
                  referred to as &quot;P.C.'s&quot; or &quot;pre-checked&quot; plans, that conform 
                  to structural and seismic safety specifications administered 
                  by the California Department of State Architects (DSA). </p>
                  <p>Global Modular also enjoys the benefit of providing 
                  educational customers with products contracted under a 
                  &quot;piggyback clause&quot;. The State of California allows school 
                  districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors 
                  under a bidding process where the successful bidder can 
                  provide other public school districts and municipalities 
                  portable classrooms under a &quot;piggyback contract&quot; issued by the 
                  originating school district. This process saves school 
                  districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of 
                  soliciting bids. </p>
                  <p>A modular vendor who possesses a &quot;piggyback contract&quot; 
                  containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options 
                  may have access to future business for up to five years, 
                  depending on the term of the piggyback contract. </p>

                  <h4>The Strategic Focus on California Schools</h4>
                  </font>
                  <p>Since 1998, California legislation has required that at 
                  least 20% of all new classrooms constructed with State funds 
                  be portable structures. </p>
                  <p>There are five compelling reasons for this trend: </p>
                  <p></li>
                  <li>Modular classrooms are FASTER to construct (as quickly as 
                  2 weeks)
                  <p></li>
                  <li>They cost significantly less (as low as $30,000 vs. 
                  $100,000)
                  <p></li>
                  <li>They offer greater flexibility for use compared to 
                  conventional buildings
                  <p></li>
                  <li>They are easier to finance
                  <p></li>
                  <li>They provide financing incentives
                  <p>To cope with population growth, the State Department of 
                  Education estimates that California will need more than 2,500 
                  classrooms each year for the next four years, which equates to 
                  more than 10,000 classrooms. </p>
                  <p>Due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the 
                  California Education Sector, public and private schools are 
                  expected to turn to portable/modular construction to fulfill 
                  their additional classroom requirements over the next four 
                  years. </p>

                  <p>On November 5, 2002 a $13.2 billion School Facilities 
                  Improvements bond proposal (Proposition 47) was passed by 
                  California voters. </p>
                  <p>This bond measure passage does not include an approximate 
                  $9.4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various 
                  school districts throughout the state. </p>
                  <p>A second bond measure worth $12.1 billion will go before 
                  the voters on the March 2004 ballot, which is expected to 
                  pass. </p>
                  <p>These bond measures are about three times higher than the 
                  record $9.2 billion bond California voters approved in 1998. 
                  The revenue generated from these bond measures will be used 
                  for school modernization programs, which include requirements 
                  for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction 
                  and renovations. </p>
                  <p>Money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and 
                  private schools; design upgrades and expand building space at 
                  community colleges and other institutions of higher learning 
                  throughout California. </p>
