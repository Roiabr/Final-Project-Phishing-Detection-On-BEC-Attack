Dear Friend,

I want to transfer out =A315,000,000.00
(Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) from our bank here,
I have the courage to look for a reliable and honest
 person who will be capable for this important
transaction,
believing that you will never let me down either now
or in future.

I want to transfer this money into a safe foreign
account abroad
 but i don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting
you as a
foreigner because this money can not be approved to
any local
bank here in Scotland, but can only be approved to any
foreign
account because the money is pounds sterlings and the
former
owner of the account is John Hughes and he was a
foreigner too.


I am contacting you because of the need to involve a
foreigner
with a foreign account as the real beneficiary.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the
total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for
expenses
both parties might have incurred during this process.

Send me as a matter of urgent for onward processing:

(1) Your Private: Tele& Fax Number
(2) Your Account: Number
(3) Your Account: Name
(4) Your Bank: Address
(5) Your Bank: Name
(6) Your Passport

I await your earliest reply,
Thanks.

Sincerely,
Mr. ROBERT WILLIAMS
