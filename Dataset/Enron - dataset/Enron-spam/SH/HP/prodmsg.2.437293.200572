A room without books is like a body without a soul.  
Like its politicians and its wars, society has the teenagers it deserves. 
Your life story would not make a good book. Don't even try. 
One dies only once, and then for such a long time!  
The squeaking wheel doesn't always get the grease. Sometimes it gets replaced.
