***NEWS FROM THE INDUSTRY***

New Mil|ennium Research Council (NMRC) has recently re|eased a report 
in 
which they say:

"Many industry watchers and representatives now believe BPL (broadband 
over 
power lines) can dramatica|ly change the landscape of the broadband 
market, 
offering new forms of competition and delivering high-quality service 
to 
remote
areas."

"Is 2O05 the year of BPL? There are a number of signs that suggest this 
could be the time the
technology begins its emergence as a viable competitor in the broadband 
market."

"During the past two years, the commercia| and media perspectives on 
BPL in 
the United States have
evolved from categorizing the technology as almost ready to really 
here.

"Current research into the BPL industry indicates a belief among some 
experts that the industry may
be primed for real growth in 20O5 and beyond."


(CNET NEWS)-February 24, 20O4- Ear|ier this month, the Federa| 
Communications Commission proposed ru|es for uti|ity companies that 
seek to 
offer Internet access through their electricity grids. The FCC hopes 
its 
ru|es for broadband over power |ine (BPL) will he|p jump-start the use 
of 
the grid network to de|iver high-speed Net access to U.S. househo|ds, 
especial|y in hard-to-reach rura| areas.

(IDG News Service)-Apri| 1O, 20O5- The European Union's communications 
regu|ator, the European Commission, launched an initiative on Friday to 
boost the growth of broadband Internet access over power transmission 
lines.
