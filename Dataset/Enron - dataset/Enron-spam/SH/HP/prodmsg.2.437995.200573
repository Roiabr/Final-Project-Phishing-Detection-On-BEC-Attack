***NEWS FROM THE INDUSTRY***

New Millennium Research Council (NMRC) has recently released a report 
in 
which they say:

"Many industry watchers and representatives now believe BPL (broadband 
over 
power lines) can dramatically change the landscape of the broadband 
market, 
offering new forms of competition and delivering high-quality service 
to 
remote
areas."

"Is 2005 the year of BPL? There are a number of signs that suggest this 
could be the time the
technology begins its emergence as a viable competitor in the broadband 
market."

"During the past two years, the commercial and media perspectives on 
BPL in 
the United States have
evolved from categorizing the technology as almost ready¶ to really 
here.¶

"Current research into the BPL industry indicates a belief among some 
experts that the industry may
be primed for real growth in 2005 and beyond."


(CNET NEWS)-February 24, 2004- Earlier this month, the Federal 
Communications Commission proposed rules for utility companies that 
seek to 
offer Internet access through their electricity grids. The FCC hopes 
its 
rules for broadband over power line (BPL) will help jump-start the use 
of 
the grid network to deliver high-speed Net access to U.S. households, 
especially in hard-to-reach rural areas.

(IDG News Service)-April 10, 2005- The European Union's communications 
regulator, the European Commission, launched an initiative on Friday to 
boost the growth of broadband Internet access over power transmission 
lines.


The news on this sector is everywhere.  2005 is the year for Advanced 
Powerline Technologies.
