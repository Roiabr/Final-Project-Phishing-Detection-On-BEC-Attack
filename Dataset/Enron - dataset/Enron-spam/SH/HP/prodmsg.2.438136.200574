My late husband was killed during the invasion of collition forces from
American and Britain in Iraq and during the period of our marriage
we couldn't produce any child My late husband was very wealthy and

Therefore my desire now is to contribute part of this wealth for
humanitarian aid such as propagation in assisting the less-privileged 
and to
use part of the fund to acquire a better medical treatment else where
in Europe or America
I am willing to give out 20% of the sum to you for helping me to
retrieve this money and transferring it to your account for the said
purpose the deposited amount is $4=2E5 million united states dollars=2E

to a lawyer who will file application for the retrieving of
the money on your name as the beneficiary only if you promise to use
this funds judiciary for the said purpose=2E
