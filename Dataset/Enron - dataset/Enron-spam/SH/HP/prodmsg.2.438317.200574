How have you been,

But this is where you come in: Between now and November, you, the American people, you can reject the tired, old, hateful, negative politics of the past. And instead you can embrace the politics of hope, the politics of what's possible because this is America, where everything is possible.

Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example.	

Goodbye,

Lakeisha Wayne
