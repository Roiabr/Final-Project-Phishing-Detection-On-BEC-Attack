Good day,

I am Mr. Olufemi Olugbade, a Bank executive. I am sending this message to you in
confidence and I am asking for your favour in the transfer of some money
belonging to one Mr. Barry Kelly (Deceased) whose death we were not aware of
until we no longer got replies to our routine notifications to his forwarding
address.

We were however told by his employers that he died from an automobile crash.
Now, all attempts to trace his Next of Kin have proved abortive. There is
however no trace in any of his official documents of a Next of Kin.
Please understand that the basic line here is that upon the expiration of
6years, the money would revert to the ownership of the government. Please also
understand that nobody is ever going to claim this money having 5 and a half
years in our bank.

So, all I am asking from you is that you should stand in as the next of kin to
avoid the money going into the hands of corrupt government officials. Also note
that it is impossible for the money to leave the coffers of the bank without a
next of kin, who also must be a foreigner.

Further workings of this initiative, and a sharing ratio plus posible areas of
investment would be discussed as soon as I hear from you.

Best Regards,
Olufemi Olugbade
