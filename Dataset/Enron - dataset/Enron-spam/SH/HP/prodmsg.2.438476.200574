Attention: Friend,

REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP OF GREAT PROFITS
I am HON. Dr.Emeka Emeka .the Director of Procurement and Contract 
Award at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of the 
Federal Republic of Nigeria. I apologized using this medium to reach 
you for a transaction/ business of this magnitude,but this is due to 
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. It is with 
trust that I wish to contact you on this matter concerning the 
transfer of US$15.5Million Dollars.Sometime ago, a contract was 
awarded by my 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to an International Oil Firm, to Service, 
Turn Around Maintenance and Rehabilitation Work on Kaduna Refinery and 
Petrochemical Company (KRPC) Plant  in Nigeria.
This contract was over-invoiced by us (myself and two junior 
colleagues) to the tune of (US$15.5 Million United State Dollars). 
Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original 
contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which 
we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested 
Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will 
provide. It is based on this that some officials in my department and 
I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you, 
hence my contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the 
Beneficiary to this fund, so that we can 
release the fund into your account  for safety and subsequent 
disbursement.We have all modalities set.
We have been disappointed some years ago by a British, Mr. Rick 
Williams whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the 
tune of US$10 Million U.S. Dollars. He is sitting on our money for no 
apparent reason and refused to give us our share but we believe that 
for his act of wickedness to us, he will never go unpunished by God. 
Mr. Rick Williams still resides in London and 
enjoying our collective money.Because of this we are afraid and we 
need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and 
straight-forward person.
As, we are willing to try again with you believing in your good 
cooperation and Faithfullness.
We have agreed to share the money thus:
1. 30% for the account owner (you).
2. 60% for me and my partners
3. 10% to be used in offsetting taxes and all local & foreign expenses.
Please, note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free and we 
will commence the transaction from the date of receipt of the 
following information from you via e-mail.
Please if you accept this proposal, send to me by e-mail.
1. Your personal telephone and fax numbers.
2. Your Bank name, address, telephone, fax as well as 
your Bank Account numbers. Or you open a new account for this 
business.  With these information, we are going to put in application 
for the release of this funds (US 15.5M) into your account for us all. 
Due to   our  sensitive position, we can not afford a slip in this 
transaction so contact me immediately through my e-email address 
TELEPHONE NUMBER: 234-802-850-9073   for further information on the  
requirements and procedure for this transaction.It will only take four 
working days to conclude this business because once you send your full 
name and address with your direct phone and fax number, we shall 
credit your account through our Reserved Account in Europe or CANADA. 
Remember that my present situation will not allow me to search for 
another person, I absolutely HOLD YOU ON TRUST.
Therefore we urge you to respond immediately to this my email address  
to enable me commence with the modalities of this transfer as we are 
well prepared to do this promising transaction with you and hope to 
continue with you in future. Please treat with the strictest 
confidentiality and utmost urgency.Yours
faithfully,
Dr.Paul Emeka
