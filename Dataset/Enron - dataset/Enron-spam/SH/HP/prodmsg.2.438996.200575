            Sports Alumni, Inc &#133;&#133;maybe you started playing football when you 
            where 8 years old and never quite lost the love of the game. Perhaps 
            you even played college ball.&nbsp; What ever level you played, it&#146;s a 
            good bet that your passion for the game did not end when the whistle 
            blew and the last play ended. That is what American Football Alumni 
            seeks to bring back to the multi-million-member target market of 
            former and current players and coaches.</span></p>

            Recent surveys reveal that 70 percent of former football players 
            would be interested in joining a national alumni association whose 
            makeup is former high school and college players. Seventy-nine 
            percent are interested in reunions with former teammates and 55 
            percent said they'd be interested in purchasing their old school 
            football jerseys, especially if their names were included. </span>
