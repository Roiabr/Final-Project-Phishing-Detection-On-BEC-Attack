    The best thing to happen to mornings since the Sun!


           Your morning thought for the day:
               Retirement at 65 is ridiculous.
               When I was 65 I still had pimples.
                                   -- George Burns

      It's summer vacation time and parents will soon be hearing from 
their kids that they're bored.
      One of the biggest regrets we hear from the older generation, is 
that kids lack the playful imagination that was common a generation 
or two ago.
      Back in the "olden days", kids knew how to entertain themselves 
with surprisingly little.  There was no such thing as Playstation. 
Kids ran outside to play kick-the-can in a game that was shockingly 
NOT organized by adults.  They actually did it themselves.
      Today, Mike shares some thoughts about kids and modern 
imagination -- or lack thereof...
      What do you think?

JUST IMAGINE
by Michael T. Smith

      When I married Ginny, I gained a new son, daughter and four 
grandsons.  I became an instant grandpa.
      Over the July 4th holiday, I got to meet my new daughter and her 
three boys for the first time.  It took a day for my new grandsons to 
warm up to me.
      The first day they stared at me, perhaps wondering what they 
were supposed to do with this man, who they were told is "grandpa." 
I waited patiently.  I knew boys like to play.  They'd come to me in 
their own time.
      On day two, the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap. 
The youngest, Ben, took a little longer, but yesterday he raced me 
across the yard thirty times and won every time.
      The weekend brought back memories of my own childhood.  We had 
such imaginations.  In our minds, a tree was a tower to spot 
approaching bad guys, a big rock became a mountain, a fallen log a 
space ship headed to the stars.  We had toys, but we had to use our 
imagination, not like the new toys I see my grandkids with.
      Our toys didn't talk, and if they did, you pulled a string to 
make it work.  We had blocks to build, crayons to create, trucks and 
cars to push.  They were simple toys that required imagination.  I 
thought about the toys in my garage, the ones I saved, when my 
children outgrew them.  They were simple and needed their imagination 
to work.  Mr. Potato Head allowed them to learn parts of the body and 
giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been.
      I still have an old plastic phone.  It has a dial to turn, a 
bell that rings when you push a button, and that's it.  It doesn't 
talk, squawk, beep or move around the room.  It's simple and was used 
when they played house, nurse, doctor, and secretary.
      I have a toy doctor's bag, with all the plastic doctor's tools. 
I remember all the broken bones, cuts, bangs, scratches and aches my 
daughter repaired as I lay in her office moaning.
      Most toys today do it all.  We don't need imagination -- it 
comes in a box.  Video games that take us into another world or 
reality, talking toys, with vocabularies better than most people, 
computerized toys to teach the alphabet.  Kids sit and have 
imagination brought to them.  The teaching toys are great, but 
children tire of them -- it's like being in school.
      When my son was young and tired of his toys, he would come to me 
and say, "Dad, I'm bored."
      "Go find something to do," I'd reply.
      "I don't know what to do."
      "Go outside and find a friend."
      "Naaa!  I don't want to do that."
      "Use your imagination."
      "Huh?" he asked.
      "Well, when I was young..."  You know the routine.
      Sports is the same.  We're entertained for hours watching 
someone else have fun doing what they're good at.  Wouldn't it be 
better to be playing yourself?  If we don't like the sports available 
to watch, we create new ones.  It doesn't matter what, people will 
pay to see it, because they need to be entertained.  I haven't heard 
of world championship worm digging, but if someone offered a large 
cash price, people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants.
      I worry.  Are we becoming a society that needs outside influence 
to have fun?
      I think I'll go climb a tree.
      Maybe there's a pirate ship on the horizon or someone is 
attacking my castle.
      Just imagine.

FROM OUR MAILBAG:
(in response to last week's story, Cinderella Men)

Dear Heartwarmers:
      Last week's heartwarming story opened a door to memory lane.  I 
too, was born in the 30s and felt some of the poverty of that time. 
I remember my mom and dad who never complained of the fatigue that 
was so ever present in their lives.  We were very fortunate in as 
much as we always had plenty of food and warm shelter.  We had a 
garden and salvaged every edible product available -- even certain 
"weeds" that were quite tasty after mother got all the spices in 
them.  I had several beautiful dresses made from feed sacks that I 
wore with pride!  We were very poor, but so rich indeed because we 
had love and the knowledge that God was upper most in our lives, and 
it taught us lessons that had never been printed in the books.  I 
deeply appreciate those lessons of long ago because they have taught 
me how to handle the tough times we have encountered in this life of 
prosperity and promise.  Thank you again for your lovely story.  God 
bless.
                 -- <JCline3053 @ aol.com>
