Hi,

I'm writing to ask if you would be interested in exchanging links with my
website at www.uk18dvd.com.

I've taken the liberty of already adding your site to my links section in
the unconfirmed links category. 

 
http://www.uk18dvd.com/links/index.html

 
All new links are added here until a link back can be confirmed. Once this
is done the link is moved to a category of your choice.

 
If you would like to confirm this exchange please link to my site,
http://www.uk18dvd.com using the text - Adult DVDs and Porn DVDs. The HTML
that needs to be put on your site is,

<a href="http://www.uk18dvd.com">Adult DVDs and Porn DVDs</a> - Adult DVDs
supplied worldwide to the UK, Europe and the USA and Canada 

Once this has been added please let me know it's location and also what
category you would like you link to be moved to. If you want any specific
text used in the title and description please let me know this as well.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

 

Matt
