Africa (U.B.A) Enugu main branch. I have an obscured business suggestion
for 
you. One of our clients/personal friend, Late Mr. Wilson Scott an 
American who was a private business man unfortunately lost his life in an=


automobile accident on January 31st 2000, including his wife and his only=


daughter.
 
Late Mr. Wilson Scott is a foreigner and the manager of Gold Minning 
Nigeria, and he died since the year 2000. No other person knows about 
this account or anything concerning it. After further investigation it wa=
s

also discovered that Mr. Wilson Scott's next of kin is his daughter who

died with him, the account has no other beneficiary and my 
investigation proves to me as well that his company does not know anythin=
g
about 
this account and the amount involved is (U.S. $26,000,000.00).
 
I am contacting you to stand and act as the next of kin to Mr. Wilson 
Scott, At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the

total amount, while 60% will be for me, while 10% will be for expenses,

both parties might have incurred during the process of this 
transaction.
