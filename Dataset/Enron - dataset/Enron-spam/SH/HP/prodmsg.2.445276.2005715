Primarily, GeneThera's expertise focuses on technology relevant to animal and human immunotherapy. GeneThera is dedicated to furnishing dependable, high quality, cost-effective and prompt client consulting services. These services are backed by the cumulative experiences of greater than 100 years of research and development in both government and industry by GeneThera's senior scientists. GeneThera develops a commercial-scale implementation of Adenovector Purification Process to support R&amp;D material production. Furthermore, GeneThera evaluates and tests commercially available expression vectors and incorporates them into its vector repertoire. These technologies are well established within the repertoire of GeneThera's scientific staff. </font></p>

<p CLASS="style29"><font color="#FFFFFF">&#147;GeneThera can uniquely detect and treat a variety of diseases in animals while they are still alive.&#148;</font></p>
<p CLASS="style15"><font color="#FFFFFF">The Company provides genetics-based diagnostic and vaccine solutions to meet the growing demands of today's veterinary industry and tomorrow's agriculture and healthcare industries. The company is organized and operated both to continually apply its scientific research to more effective management of diseases and, in so doing, realize the commercial potential of molecular biotechnology. </font></p>
<p CLASS="style15"><font color="#FFFFFF">The core of GeneThera's operation is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays using Real Time Fluorogenic Polymerase Chain Reaction. (F-PCR) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases. It also allows for the efficient, effective, and continuous testing, management and treatment of animal populations. These facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today -- all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds. Our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals, but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>To date, GeneThera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect Mad Cow and Chronic Wasting Disease, a disease affecting elk and deer in North America . </strong> Diagnostic assays for E.coli O157:H7 and Johnne's Disease are in the final stages of development. Vaccines for E.coli O157:H7 and Johnne's Disease, both of which are diseases affecting cattle, are in advanced stages of development. In the future, the Company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases/animals, the immediate targets being Mad Cow, Hoof &amp; Mouth, West Nile and Newcastle . </font></p>
<p CLASS="style15"><font color="#FFFFFF">GeneThera can detect BSE using the companies patented Live animal blood test that evaluates The E.D.R.F. gene sequence. The E.D.R.F. gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any TSE infection is noticeable in a LIVE animal or human. The patent GTHA holds is broad based and can detect all TSE diseases including Mad Cow (BSE) in cattle, CWD in elk &amp; deer and Creutzfeld-Jacobs in Humans</font></p>

<p CLASS="style15"><font color="#FFFFFF">The company's patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost. The test can also be used on a MASS scale using Roche F-PCR, DNA analyzing robotics equipment. <strong>GeneThera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one F-PCR machine and a single technician. </strong>The project will prove highly profitable at approx $4.00 <img src="http://www.lvmail.biz/a2zfiles/d/drc/7_13_05_gtha/blood.jpg" width="60" height="257" align="right">per test when wide scale commercialization is under way. </font></p>
<p CLASS="style15"><font color="#FFFFFF"><STRONG>A multi-billion dollar </STRONG>, international demand for commercial Mad Cow testing has emerged around the globe. </font></p>
<p CLASS="style15"><font color="#FFFFFF">Japan conducted 3 million post-mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone. They used The Western Blot developed by Prionics AG in Swizterland and Bio-Rad's rapid test. Costs are between $20 and $40 dollars per test. Most importantly, other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed. Testing through post-mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly. </font></p>
<p CLASS="style15"><font color="#FFFFFF">Japan spent between <strong>$60 Million - $120 Million </strong> on <em>3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004. </em></font></p>

<p CLASS="style2"><font color="#FFFFFF"><SPAN CLASS="style5">GeneThera's simple blood test can be collected using their patented Field Collection System &#153;. The sample is then mailed to the lab for testing.
