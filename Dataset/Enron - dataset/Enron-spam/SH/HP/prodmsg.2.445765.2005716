<BR><BR>--<BR>Hello, <BR>I am Mrs. Juliet Kerr from Maldrid, presently
staying in United Kingdom. I am married to Mr. Wilson Kerr who worked as the
financial Director United nation Development on Africa for more than thirty
years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for thirty years
without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
days.Before his death we were both Christians. Since his death I decided not
to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is
against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 16.8Million
pounds sterling (Sixteen Million Eight hundred thousand pounds sterling)
with one Security Company in my name. Presently, this money is still with
the Security company in Europe. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not
last long due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke
sickness. Having known my condition I decided to keep this fund in the
Security Company in Europe. I want an organization or an individual that
will use this fund for orphanages, widows and helping the destitudes. I took
this decision because I don\'t have any child that will inherit this money
and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don\'t want my husband\'s
efforts to be used by wicked people. I don\'t want a situation where this
money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision.
I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I don\'t need any
telephone communication in this regard because of my ill health hence the
presence of my husband\'s relatives around me always. I don\'t want them to
know about this development. All things are possible. As soon as I receive
your reply I shall inform the Security Company in Europe that you are the
beneficiary of the said consignment you will need to go and claim this fund
in Europe. I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the
present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the organization to always
pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Any
delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated
herein.Hoping to receive your reply and Remain blessed. <BR>Yours in christ,
<BR>Mrs Juliet <BR><BR><BR><BR />
