Judgment Processing Professional.

Dear Jim,

I can't thank you enough for introducting me to this business.

You have given me a fresh lease on life.  

I was terminated from a job I held for 26 years. I am already earning twice
as much as I earned in my old job. I am making way over my old boss's pay.  

I drive a 2005 Jaguar S Type and my old boss has an 8 year old Ford Van.

I am earning at the 6 digit level in a year and a half.

I am having a ball in this business. 

Its fun and I am a hero to the courts and to my clients.  What an exciting
profession to be in.

Doing exactly what your training tells me to do, is working beautifully.  I
go to the court and locate all of the clients I can handle.  

I use your advanced reporting services to locate all assets and jobs. Using
your forms I send them out to the appropriate agencies.

Then the $$ arrive to yours truely.  Its like magic.  I love it.

I am able to take a holiday when ever I have a whim to do so.  Hawaii and a
1050 footer to the Panama Canal etc. so far this year.

Please show this reference to others.  

This industry is so big it requires lots of us helping the courts and the
people who have been damaged.

Sincerely

George A.  In Ohio

Thank you, murmured the boy. The Demon bowed and spread his hands in the
form of a semi-circle
An instant later there was a blinding flash, and when Rob recovered from it
and opened his eyes the Demon of Electricity had disappeared
