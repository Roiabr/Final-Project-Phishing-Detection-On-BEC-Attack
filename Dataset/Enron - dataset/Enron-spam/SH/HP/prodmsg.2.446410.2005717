Hi,
I have been using your site for a long time now, I am very insterested
on the PSP so I decided to make my own PSP site a few months ago, it
is going great now.
I wanted to ask you if you would be interested on doing a link exchange wit=
h me.
The site is www.hackmypsp.com, we have a links page at
http://www.hackmypsp.com/links and we also have a links sidebar on
most pages, your site would be listed in both the links page and the
links sidebars.
If you are interested then please add my site somewhere on your page.
I would like something like the following, but I will take anything as
long as it links to www.hackmypsp.com:

PSP news, hacks, downloads and tutorials.
Get PSP Hacks here
Hack your PSP
Great PSP Hack site
Search for PSP downloads

Just to keep this organized, please add me to your page and email me
back a link to it, I will then add your page to my website and let you
know its done, please send me a short description (under 30 letters)
as well as the link you wish me to point to.
I hope you decide to do this exchange with me, and keep up the great work.

Thank you,

Miguel Whitney
