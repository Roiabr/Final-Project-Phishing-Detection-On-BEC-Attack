FROM THE DESK OF=3A BARR Arisman Shonikon
CHAMBERS & ASSOCIATES
NO 56B=2E ABA ROAD=2C PORT-HARCOURT NIGERIA
Private Email Address =28Barrarismanshonikon=40shymail=2Ecom=29 
Dear 
I sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy especially by 
contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this 
magnitude=2C but due to its seriousness and urgency it therefore became 
necessary for me to seek your assistance=2E
I am Barr=2EArisman shonikon=2C the personal lawyer to Late Mr=2E FRANK IONESCU=2C a 
foreigner=2C who worked with an Oil Servicing Company in the oil rich Niger 
Delta Area of Bayelsa State=2E I am contacting you concerning my late client 
and an investment he made=2E I would respectfully request that you keep the 
contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the 
information you come by as a result of this mail=2E I contacted you 
independently and no one should be informed of this communication=2E I would 
like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest 
to you=2E
This is a genuine transaction and is 100% risk free=2E All I'm demanding from 
you is your honest co-operation to enable us achieve our goal=2C and not a 
perfidious person=2E On the 6th of May=2C 2002 it was reported to us that my 
Client=2C his wife and their only daughter were involved in a Local Plane 
Crash at Kano State=2C enroot Abuja =28The Capital City=29 all occupants in the 
Plane lost their lives=2C unfortunately on this same flight were other 
dignitaries like the Sports Minister and a host of others
Meanwhile=2C until his death=2C my late client had a Fixed Deposit Account of 
USD $15=2E Million deposited in a Security Company =28 UNIC SECURITY COMPANY=29 
here=2E Recently=2C I received an ultimatum from the Security Company asking me 
to provide my late client's relative so that the money would be given to 
them=2E But unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not 
declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he 
tendered to the Security Company while opening the account=2E
Therefore=2C this development leaves me as the only person with the full 
picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my 
late client made and who is entitled to be the Bona Fide Beneficiary=2FNext of 
Kin or relative because he died intestate=2E Therefore=2C if I fail to locate 
any of his relatives or his next of kin =28and have this money transferred to 
them=29 the Security Company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum 
given to me confiscate the account=2E
According to the ultimatum issued to me by the Security Company=2C if I fail 
to present to them my late client's relative=2C with a legitimate statement of 
claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account 
and the money declared 'UNCLAIMED BALANCE'=2E This will result in the money 
being taken over by the Security Company=2E This will not happen if I have my 
way=2E
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client 
all these while=2C my proposal=2C therefore=2C is to present you as the next of 
kin=2Frelative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can 
easily pass as a possible relative of my client=2E I know you will be 
wondering how possible this could be but I assure you that this is simple=2E
I therefore seek your consent to present you as the Next Of Kin to my client 
so that the money he deposited with the Security Company would be paid to 
you and there after you and I will share the money 40% for you and I will be 
taking 60%=2E I assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a 
few days because I have all the relevant information that would facilitate 
that will be required on Documentation=2E
First=2C I will like you to provide immediately the following information=3A
Your full names=2E
Contact address=2E
Telephone=2FFax Numbers=2E
With this information I will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit 
that will put you in place as the next of kin=2E After we have successfully 
satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling USD 15=2EMillion 
would be paid into your account for you to take 40% and I will be taking 
60%=2E All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this 
through=2E
There is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my 
position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything=2E Secondly=2C I 
will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence 
proving that you are the Next of Kin=2F Relative of my late client=2E These 
documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the Beneficiary 
of the Estate of my late client=2E
What I related to you might smack of unethical practice but I want you to
understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning
around our situation=2E The truth is that this money would not be taken by the
government but by some greedy Security Company Officials and I would not
fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you=2E

If you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your 

reply to this email address=3A =28arismanshonikon=40shymail=2Ecom=29

Thank you as I await your positive response=2E
