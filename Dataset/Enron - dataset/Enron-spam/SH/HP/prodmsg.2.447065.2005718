Dear Sir/Madam I apologize if the contents hereunder are contrary to=20

personal courtesy. I am Dale Williams an Auditor of a commercial Bank=20
here in the United Kingdom,in the the process of auditing our bank=20
accounts I and one of my colleagues discovered that there is a dormant acco=
unt
valued at the sum =A328,700,000.00
(twenty eight million seven hundred thousand British Pounds) and after due
verification of this account we discovered that the account owner is late a=
nd
that is why the account has been dormant and as such a =A328,700,000.00 has=
 been
lying in the bank unclaimed.

The idea of presenting somebody who is not related to our deceased=20
customer to act as his next of kin came into our mind, that is how and why =
we
have contacted you to present you as his next of kin, so that the
=A328,700,000.00 will be paid to you and we can both disburse the fund acco=
rding
to the percentage we will agree on. In view of this, I am seeking for your
co-operation and understanding to stand as the next of kin to our deceased
customer, to enable us claim the fund from my bank. Hence, If this proposal=
 is
OK by you and you do not wish to take undue advantage of my trust, then I h=
ope
to bestow on you.

Please kindly get back to me immediately, strictly via my private email
address only: dalewilliams@audithordalewilliams.com to enable me enlighten =
you
on how we are to proceed. On getting your response, we shall agree on the
percentage of disbursing the =A328,700,000.00 between us, as we intend to i=
nvest
part of our own share in real estate business in your country, and we would
appreciate if you can put us in the right part investing in your country. I
will not contact any person or company until I hear from you, so as to enab=
le
me decide on what to do next. Be rest assured that this business is 100% ri=
sk
free. We await for your prompt response.

Regards,
Dale Williams

NB: PLEASE NOTE THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE NOT RELATED TO MY=20
LATE CUSTOMER, THE FUND WILL STILL BE PAID TO YOU, SINCE WE ARE=20
PRESENTING YOU AS HIS NEXT OF KIN.
