Hello objective-view.de

I wanted follow up to yesterdays email to point out the Glasglow Partner
Program to those who may be interested. We offer a 40% discount and
exclusive license agreement for your region. We do dropship using DHL free
of charge. If this may be something that interests you please let me know.

If we are already in negotiation, exchanged links or you have listed
yourself on the remove list please disregard this email and no further
reply is required.

Sincerely
Michael

If you do not wish to receive further updates please enter your email at
http://www.cbxsales.com/un.html. They have agreed to send us the remove
lists so that we do not keep bothering those that do not wish to be
bothered.
