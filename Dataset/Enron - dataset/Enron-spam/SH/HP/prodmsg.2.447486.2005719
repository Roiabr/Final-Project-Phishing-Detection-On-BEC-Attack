Thanks for contacting Intellexual.net, your message has been 
received on our servers; However, we do get a high volume of 
incoming mail and due to an everchanging schedule are increasingly 
unable to address each and every one. Contacting me to 
diagnose/solve your case-by-case problems will probably have the 
lowest response rate. Sorry but it's impractical and time-consuming 
for me to try and fix your car over the net!
