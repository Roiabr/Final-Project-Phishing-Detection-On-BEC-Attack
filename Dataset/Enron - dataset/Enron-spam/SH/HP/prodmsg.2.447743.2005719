account of the federal pay office to your account as soon as possible.
 
Source of the funds are:  
 
During the Arap Moi's government, government's officials awarded contracts to =

operate foreign account, and I have been mandated to search for a partner =
abroad. We really want this transfer made as soon as possible before the =

track this money. We will be offering 20% for your assistance.
