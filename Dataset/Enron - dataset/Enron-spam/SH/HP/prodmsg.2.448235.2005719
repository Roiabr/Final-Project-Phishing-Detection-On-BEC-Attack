      <p>Maybe it's something you've always thought about doing, but didn't know where to start, how to start, when to start&#133;. or even if an opportunity like this existed.</p>
      <p><strong>It does! And A Touch of Class would like you to invite you to be a part of it. </strong></p>
      <p>Wedding Consulting isn't wedding planning. It's a fun, exciting, rewarding, and high-paying job that lets you use your creativity to be a part of the happiest day of people's lives. Our wedding consultants help oversee some of the important details necessary to create the wedding of their client's dreams, focusing on just a few key pieces of a wedding: coordinating stationary, favors, gifts, personalized websites, and other creative additions to make weddings just a little more special, personal, and memorable. </p>
      <p><a href='http://dfzmail.info/080E1B1F171E16135C02171C1C321A025C130706010B015C111D1F0E454B4A47440E460E400E404A4A4A4343420E08.aspx'><img src="http://images.dfzmail.info/a2zfiles/a/atouchofclass/mes1cid1/img002.jpg" width="160" height="194" border="0" align="left"></a>A Touch of Class&reg; wedding consulting provides a new and exciting opportunity for you to take a bold step for yourself, and serve the needs of many others in the process.
