      <p>Enjoy Media Holdings Limited (Pink Sheets:EJYM) ( <a href='http://dfzmail.info/080E1613051C11131E16170013001D321A1D1F175C1A07151A17015F0600131C011E13061B1D1C015C111D1F0E4A4143444A0E400E400E404B414B4445440E08.aspx'>www.enjoymedia.com </a> ), a print media and advertising services company in China, discusses about the Company's objectives and planned prospects for the coming months. </p>
      <p>The key initiatives for the Company are: &nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expand the existing network of restaurants and cafes </li>
        <li> Increase the advertising sales revenue of the current printed media </li>
        <li> Acquire additional &quot;Wait media&quot; businesses </li>
      </ul>      <p>Enjoy Media is a pioneer in the field of printed advertising media placed in restaurants in China . It supplies paper products, such as paper placemats, napkins and other displays, displaying advertisements, free of charge, to restaurants and cafes. Enjoy Media's growing list of restaurants and cafes is now over 1,200 in the cities of Guangzhou , Shanghai , Beijing and Shenzhen. </p>
      <p>The printed media, termed &quot;Wait Media,&quot; showcases advertisements to customers while waiting for their food order and during their dining time. The restaurants and cafes in the Enjoy Media network, such as trendy cafes, western food restaurants and fast-food franchises, typically operate in multiple locations in high traffic areas, and attract young urban and white-collar customers. Enjoy Media keeps advertisers informed of customer profiles, and helps them to design and produce suitable advertisements. </p>
      <p>Mr. Bill Lu, President of the Company, said, &quot;The Chinese advertising industry is the world's 4th largest market with over US$10 billion expenditure in 2005 and double-digit growths in the last decade estimated by Merrill Lynch. Coupled with China's booming restaurant sales, which Bloomberg reports to be estimated at US$106 billion with 18% growth in 2005, it is reasonable to expect Enjoy Media will benefit directly from China's phenomenal growth in advertising and dining spending. We are eager to extend our success to other cities in China leveraging our current first mover advantages. We also plan to expand our sales team to increase our advertiser base. These steps will likely bring a significant boost to Enjoy Media's revenue in 2005 and time ahead. We are at the same time looking for other 'Wait Media' opportunities to complement our business.&quot; </p>
