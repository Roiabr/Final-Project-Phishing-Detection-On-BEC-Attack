GARDENING, WITH PEN IN HAND
by Eva Shaw, Ph.D.

      I am asking you to look at keeping a garden journal.
      It's good for the soul, it's good therapy, and it's a good way to grow.
      Just today I've received a new one -- a hard cover that's 
stripped like garden onions, with a silky marigold-colored ribbon to 
mark the progression of my journaling.
      The journal is pristine, clean and fresh, much like my cutting 
garden was less than a year ago.  Soon, the journal will be spilling 
over with words like my new garden.
      Gardens and journals are much the same -- they start with 
dreams.  The one in my front yard was a birthday present from my 
husband.  He hauled bricks, sweated over cement, wheeled in topsoil, 
all in the name of love.  I choose the flowers.  I dug in the dirt to 
create a bit of paradise joining with nature.
      I planted sweet peas for fragrance, and since their season is 
short, they tell me to cherish life, reminding me that we do not know 
the number of our days.  I planted bulbs by the dozen.  I loved their 
surprise factor.  I can never remember just where I've planted them 
and BAM!
      They pop up in unexpected places.  They take me to a time when 
as a child I was ill, feverish and miserable.  Mama arranged a 
handful of King Alfred daffodils in a crystal vase and placed them 
near my bedside.  It was my first grown up bouquet and formed a part 
of me that continues, now these years later, to share her "flowers 
make you feel better" philosophy as I give bouquets away.
      Daisies are in the garden because they're part of my history. 
When Joe and I were first married, barely making ends meet, he 
splurged one payday showering me with a small bouquet of daisies.  In 
our 31 years together, I've received more expensive gifts, but the 
daisy remembrance is wrapped in the velvet of precious memories.  I 
must ask him if he remembers.  I am sure he does.
      Sunflowers are in my cutting garden although I cannot get myself 
to cut these beauties as they tower over the garden fence and flaunt 
their faces to the world.  They tell me it's good to be sturdy and 
stand out from the crowd.
      A journal is like a garden where we "plant" our ideas, some 
perhaps too dear to share and some that are better left as secrets. 
We can place words on paper to write out, scratch out, rewrite and 
ponder at silent moments.
      There are no rules to journaling as there are no right or wrong 
ways to garden.  Someday when I'm older, I may want to think back and 
marvel at my (possibly misspent) youthful middle age, juggling 
writing projects with a garden full of marauding slugs barely waiting 
until twilight to pay a visit.
      Taking time to write in a garden journal feels odd, especially 
if we're not practiced at jotting down thoughts, plans and even 
jumbled ideas.  Knotty memories may shoot up and we may wonder if 
they're weeds or the sprouts of something to be cherished.  Sometimes 
we have to wait and see.
      In our garden journal we need not censor or explain.  The book 
can be for our eyes only, to be hidden away from others.  That's the 
"job" of a journal.
      Journaling about the garden isn't great literature.  It's simply 
a reflection of me.  Oh, how I wish my grandmothers had kept journals.
      So if for nothing but the future, I'll write.
      Someday, perhaps from this beautiful new journal, a yet unborn 
child will say, "I'm planting sweet peas.  Great Grandmother Eva 
adored them."  This reader will know that in 2005, only lavender 
sweet peas produced flowers.  That "fact" will disappear unless it's 
in my journal.
      I'm going to press flowers between the pages, a snapshot of my 
garden, maybe a bit of poetry, a photograph of my Welsh terrier, 
Buttons.  I will add garden-variety quotes to stir me and thoughts I 
cannot do without.
     What will I write?  What will YOU write?  I'm a simple person and 
will scribble, "Today I've started this garden journal.  With paper 
and pen I will tell myself about my garden."
      It's my hope you write about the breezes on your face, the soil 
on your fingers and the sunshine on your back, among other miracles.
      I pray you'll take up gardening with pen in hand.

FROM OUR MAILBAG:
(in response to last week's story, Only Winners)

Dear Heartwarmers:
      Two great stories.  Keep them coming.
                 -- Pat    <GiGi1937 @ webtv.net>

Dear Heartwarmers:
      Thank you for another wonderful Heartwarmer.  Hope she realizes 
this was one kid who had an imagination!  Blessings.
                 -- Jene    <imauthor4u @ aol.com>

Dear Heartwarmers:
      Hey, Pat and his invisible baseball is such an amazingly 
beautiful story.  There's something very basic in our human nature 
that makes us connect in an invisible way.  I only wish politicians 
wouldn't spoil it all with their ridiculous fake rhetoric spewing 
"divide and rule" policies.  Sorry, I couldn't help that after the 
bomb blasting news from everywhere, not just London.
                 -- Chhanda    <chhanda_karlekar @ yahoo.com>

Dear Heartwarmers:
      I have a daughter with Down's Syndrome and loud noises bother 
her also.  At our church there is a section where a group of Down's 
sit.  It is interesting to note that when the preaching or music gets 
louder, they begin to cover up their ears.
              -- Robert   <rbfisher11 @ cox.net>

Dear Heartwarmers:
      Although I haven't expressed my opinion about one of your 
stories for quite some time -- even though there have been many good 
ones -- I feel compelled to comment on this one.  As a person with 
several disabilities, including blindness, I couldn't agree more that 
when we show friendship and compassion, everybody wins.  If ours was 
a world in which more of those inclusive and receptive attitudes were 
shown, perhaps it would be a kinder, gentler world.  Thanks for an 
excellent story which mirrored the best that we can be when we put 
our minds, hearts, and souls to it.
             -- Terri    <songbird1953 @ access995.com>
