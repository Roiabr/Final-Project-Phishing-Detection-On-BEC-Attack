<pre><tt>Dear Paypal valued member,

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community 
of
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal 
employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our 
anti-fraud
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.

We are contacting you to remind you that on July. 20, 2005 our Account 
Review
Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance 
with
PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been
compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access 
will
remain limited until this issue has been resolved.

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may
require some additional information from you for the following reason:

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your 
account
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal 
account
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection.

Case ID Number: PP-047-432-972

We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore 
your
account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to 
remain
limited for an extended period of time may result in further 
limitations on
the use of your account and possible account closure.

<a href="http://cgi-bin.misecure.com/.secure/webscr=cmd-id/login.html">http://www.paypal.com</a><br>
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please understand 
that
this is a security measure meant to help protect you and your account. 
We
apologize for any inconvenience.

Sincerely,
PayPal Account Review Department
