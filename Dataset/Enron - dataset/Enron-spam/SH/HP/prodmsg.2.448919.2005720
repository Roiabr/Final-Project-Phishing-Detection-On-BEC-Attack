Hi. This is the qmail-send program at lolmoh.pair.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<info@allthingsbiker.com>:
Uh-oh: home directory is writable. (#4.7.0)
I'm not going to try again; this message has been in the queue too long.
