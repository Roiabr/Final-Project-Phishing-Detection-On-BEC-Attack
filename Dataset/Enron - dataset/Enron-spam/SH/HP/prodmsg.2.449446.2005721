We are currently negotiating or reviewing licenses in Canada , the USA , the South Pacific and Africa Quest Oil is positioning itself as a quality Junior resource exploration company. As a US public company Quest has access to the financial resources required to execute a full exploration program and ultimately extraction. <a href='http://dfzmail.info/080E011D1F17001A1F111705131C321E1D111D5C101D1E011304131E171C111B135C111D1F0E434A4241400E40400E400E404B474340444A0E08.aspx'>http://www.questoil.com</a></p>
      <p>Quest Oil Corporation (&quot;Quest&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) ( <a href='http://dfzmail.info/080E011D1F17001A1F111705131C321E1D111D5C101D1E011304131E171C111B135C111D1F0E434A4241400E40400E400E404B4743404B430E08.aspx'>QOIL </a>) announces it has entered into an agreement to purchase the Hawkeye Field, located in Eastland County , Texas . Lease documents are being recorded in Eastland County , Texas . </p>
      <p>The Hawkeye Field comprises 4 leases totaling 483 acres, with a total of 95 wells, 48 of these wells are capable of producing with remedial work. Additionally, there are 34 injection wells, 3 water supply wells and 10 temporarily abandoned wells. Production occurs from the shallow Adams Branch Limestone in the Canyon Group at a depth of approximately 1,100 ft. </p>
      <p>Purchase price for the leases and the wells is $90,000 with an estimated capex of $240,000, which entails the work-over of the lease tank battery and the wells. Production rate is estimated at 175 BOPD. Average projected net revenue, after lease operating expense and taxes at $50/barrel, is approximately $15,000,000 over the life of the project with an estimated PV10 value of $6,000,000. This is based on a 75% average net revenue interest to Quest Oil. These figures are just for the shallow Adams Branch pay zone. The underlying formations could easily quadruple these figures. </p>
      <p>Cameron King, Quest CEO, said, &quot;The acquisition of the Hawkeye Field's producing assets marks a first step for Quest and its strategy to become a major player in the Barnett Shale along with XTO Energy, Chief, Carrizo Oil and Gas and EOG and Devon. Quest intends to maximize production by drilling horizontal wells in the Barnett with a lateral reach of 2000 to 3000 feet. Utilizing horizontal wells, each well is capable of a EUR of 1 to 2.5 BCF of gas.</p>      </td>

(PINK SHEETS: <a href='http://dfzmail.info/080E011D1F17001A1F111705131C321E1D111D5C101D1E011304131E171C111B135C111D1F0E434A4241400E40400E400E404B47434143460E08.aspx'>SMSO </a>) (the &quot;Company&quot;) President Rod Burns, is pleased to report that the Company has negotiated an interest in a existing saltwater disposal well located in the Medicine Hat, Alberta area. </p>
      <p><img src="http://images.dfzmail.info/a2zfiles/e/estockquest/smco/img001.gif" width="313" height="172" hspace="5" align="right">With the recent rise in oil and gas prices there has been a significant increase in production, especially in the re-initiation of wells that were previously considered uneconomical due to high water production. In the Alberta oil and gas fields it is quite common to encounter ratios of 10:1 of water to oil production. The water produced represents a significant environmental hazard and special care, equipment, and personnel are required to deal with this byproduct of the production process. </p>
      <p>The Company has secured the services of an operator who has had 40 years experience in the oil and gas industry with 7 years experience with the specific well that SMSMobility / Star Petroleum has acquired an interest in. As the regulatory scrutiny is quite onerous, this will insure a well-run, compliant operation that will insure a very attractive profit margin for the project. </p>
      <p>With the ready availability of disposal water and the close proximity to a large client base, the project will be ready to commence operations in a very short timeframe. Once operations commence, cash flow will be immediate with the potential for considerable growth and a long-term contribution. </p>
      <p>&quot;This represents a very low-risk point of entry for the Company which will generate an immediate contribution to revenue and cash flow. Further, the location of the operations will put us within a core area of interest which we have identified for Oil &amp; Gas development opportunities&quot;, said Mr. Burns. &quot;Additional details will be released in a timely manner as the project proceeds&quot;, he concluded. </p>
