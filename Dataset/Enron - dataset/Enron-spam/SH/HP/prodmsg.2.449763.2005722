Human Science Systems Plans European Distribution

Company Seeks to Distribute Central Authority in Europe


CORAL SPRINGS, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)----Human Science Systems, Inc. 
(OTC:HMNS - News) a contact center consulting and software development firm, 
today announced that it is actively seeking a contact center technology 
reseller to distribute the company's flagship product, Central 
Authority(TM), in Europe.

*************** WE TOLD YOU ABOUT PNTV AT $1.10 AND NOWS IT IS $1.65 IN 4 
DAYS*****TUESDAY WILL BE BIGGER FOR HMNS

Human Science Systems CEO Lou Mandic stated, "Our original marketing and 
distribution strategy was largely centered on North American distribution, 
but our research has discovered an overwhelming amount of information that 
supports the European launch of our product." The company plans to initiate 
European distribution following the product's general availability release 
in North America.

In April of 2005, Gartner reported that it anticipates European technology 
spending to reach EUR 185 billion ($225 billion) by 2008, growing at a 
compound annual growth rate of 3.9%. Business Insights recently reported 
that the global market for contact center component technology will have 
grown to $5.1 billion by 2008.

Mandic continued, "Our goal is to attain a 5% market share of the North 
American contact center technology market within the next five years. This 
very conservative goal would yield our company approximately $10 million in 
net revenues. Garnering a small percentage of the anticipated European 
technology market would enable us to significantly increase these projected 
revenues to create not only an equally significant benefit to our company, 
but also to our shareholders. A domestic partner in Europe enables us to 
extend our reach while not over-extending our capabilities and cost 
structure."                      Keep your eye out for news and
