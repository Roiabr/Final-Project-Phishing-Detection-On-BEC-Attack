Dear Sir,

Naturally this letter will come to you as a surprise since we do not know
each other, please permit me however to introduce myself=2E I am Didan Kim=
ati, a staff of the Ministry of Finance and Economic planning here in Ghan=
a=2E At the risk of boasting, I wish you to understand that I am a top per=
sonal aid to the Minister and therefore, I am privy to several pieces of i=
nformation=2E

This aside, I am the secretary to the Contract payment committee=2E Subseq=
uent upon the recent debt relief granted by the G8 Nations to the Republic=
 of Ghana, the Government under the leadership of his Excellency, Presiden=
t John A=2E Kufour, has decided to pay off all the accumulated back-log of=
 contract debts owed to both local and foreign contractors=2E

However, some of these contract debts span from the regime of his
excellency, Osagyefo Dr=2E Kwame Nkrumah down to the PNDC government of Fl=
t=2E Lt=2E John J=2E Rawlings and to his NDC government days even to the f=
irst tenure of President Kufour=2E To this effect, some of the contractors=
 can no longer be traced as they have tried severally to receive their pay=
ment success=2E Obviously, some may have died=2E

The proposal:

I wish to implore you to come in as our partner to claim the sum of $745=20=

Million United States Dollars which is payment due some contractors who
built the Akosombo Hydro-electric dam=2E The contract was divided in 3 pha=
ses=2E The civil contractors, the water engineers and the electrical engin=
eering companies=2E I understand that you may not know anything about this=
 subject and you may not even be conversant with the procedure for buildin=
g a dam=2E But do not worry as we have covered all the bases=2E

All we need to do is apply for an initial payment of $475 Million United=20=

States Dollars for the first phase of the contract=2E As soon as this is
successfully transferred to your account, we will apply for the other
balance=2E You do not need to worry about the original contractors=2E

This has already been taken care of=2E We removed some of the files when w=
e took them for review=2E All we have to do is replace them with your comp=
any details=2E As soon as this is done, we shall approve your file for imm=
ediate  payment=2E Once again, do not worry about this, it will be approve=
d=2E

At this juncture, I wish to point out that the funds are currently deposit=
ed
at the Swiss National Bank and I am currently in Geneva where I have held =
series of meetings with the bank officials at the Swiss National Bank who =
have assured me that once the neccessary documentation are in place the fu=
nds will be directly wired to the designated account=2E Of course we will =
give them something for their troubles=2E While I am here you may reach me=
 on telephone number 0041225330355

We have estimated that it will take between 10 and 14 working days to
complete this project=2E Should you wish to participate, please contact me=
=2E=20
You may be worried about the legitimacy of this, you may also be worried
about if it were found out=2E The answer is do not worry, everything has b=
een carefully thought out and planned=2E Should you have any questions of =
whatever nature, please do not hesitate to ask me=2E By the way, you may b=
e worried as well, that this is a scam=2E There is no need for you to worr=
y=2E We do sincerely hope to work this out with you=2E

As regards what's in it for you, we propose a sharing ratio of 60:40=2E 60=
%=20
for us and 40% for you=2E If you have any problems with this, please note =
that we are open to negotiations so long as they are reasonable=2E Do acce=
pt our heart felt good wishes as I look forward to your response=2E
