MY REASON FOR CONTACTING YOU IS BASED ON 
AN URGENT NEED TO INVEST SOME FUND AMOUNTING TO $8,200,000.00

PRIVATE CONNECTIONS.THE FUND IS PRESENTLY 

WAITING TO BE REMMITTED BY 
THE APEX BANK TO ANY FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT PRESENTED BY US FOR THIS 
REMITTANCE.

HOWEVER,BY VIRTURE OF OUR POSITIONS AS CIVIL SERVANTS IN 
OUR COUNTRY,WE CAN NOT ACQUIRE THIS MONEY IN OUR NAMES,BECAUSE AS 

HIGH PLACED CIVIL SERVANTS,WE ARE NOT ALLOWED BY THE CIVIL SERVICE CODE 
OF CONDUCT TO OWN FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE OUR 

SHORES. ON THE 
OTHER HAND,IT IS NOT SAFE FOR US TO KEEP THE MONEY HERE DUE TO OUR 
UNSTABLE POLITICAL ENVIROMENT. WHAT I 

REQUEST IS A HONEST FOREIGN 
PARTNER IN WHOSE ACCOUNT WE WILL TRANSFER THE SUM OF $8,200,000.00 US 
DOLLARS FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT 

AND FURTHER INVESTMENT PROJECTS IN YOUR 
COUNTRY.

TO YOUR OWN SHARE OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION. WE HAVE 

AGREED 
THAT 30% OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS OUR FOREIGN PARTNER,IN 
RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF A FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT 

FOR THE TRANSFER,
AND 70% WOULD BE FOR ME AND MY COLLEAGUES. THEREAFTER I AND MY 
COLLEAGUES WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR 

DISBURSEMENT AND FURTHER 
INVESTMENT PROJECTS,HENCE THE REASON FOR REQUESTING YOUR SINCERE 
CO_OPERATION IN WORKING TOGETHER AS 

PARTNERS AND RECEIVE THE FUND IN 
YOUR ACCOUNT WITH TOTAL TRUST.
