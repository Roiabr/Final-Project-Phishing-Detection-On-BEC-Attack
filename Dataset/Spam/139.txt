>From : Mrs Rose Kouakou
  Abidjan, Cote d Ivoire=20
West Africa.

  Dearest one,
=20
With due respect to your humble self, I write you
this letter which I believe you would be of great
assistance to me and my children.
=20
I am MRS Rose Kouakou the wife of the late Dr
DAVID Kouakou of the blessed memory. Prior to my
husband assassination by the rebel forces loyal to
CORPORAL FODAY SANKOH of the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF), He was the Director General National
Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation of Sierra-Leone.
=20
Few days before my husband was assassinated, he
instructed me and my children ( DIDOW and Raymond) to
move out of Sierra-Leone and also to go in his
underground strong room where the documents of
money he has deposited in a security company in
Abidjan Cote d Ivoire in one trunk Box as family
valuables and treasures with the name of my first
son DIDOW Kouakou as the beneficiary. The amount is=20
US$10,500.000.00 (Ten million Five hundred thousand
United States
 =20
Dollars.)We managed to escape to Abidjan the
Republic of Cote d Ivoire through the help of my
husbands friend who is a trawler. As our travelling
document was seized.
For your information , the security company does not
know the real content of the box and we do not wish
them to know until the money is transferred to your
account. As it was deposited as family valuables and
treasures.=20
=20
Meanwhile, I want to leave Cote d'Ivoire entirely
with this money for investment in your country because
of the unstable political situation and mostly for the
future of my children. I want you to please assist
us to claim the box from the security company in
Europe. Because of the political problem here
sometimes ago,I instructed the Security Company to
transfer the consignment to their branch office in
Europe for safe keeping. So the consignment is now in
Europe. we have it in mind to reward you with a
certain percentage for your assistance. As soon as we
hear from you.
=20
immediately you
receive this letter to enable us proceed in earnest
toward retrieving the box and transferring of the
money into your account.
=20
Finally, Please ensure that no one else knows about
this money as it is only me, my son and yourself
knows about this money. Please even if you don't
want to assist me, please dont expose this for my
security.
May God bless you as you=20
