My name is Mrs Theresa Coleman, 35 years,a citizen of Sierra - Leone , wife=
 of late Fidelix Coleman, who before his death was the person managing the =
Sierra - Leone goldand diamond corporation( SGDC ).

I hope you are aware of the war which has ravaged my country for the past y=
ears now . It was in one of this attacks by the rebels that led to the deat=
h of my husband and three of my children , now I am left with only my last =
son David .=20

David from Sierra - Leone to cote d' Ivoire into a refugee camp but brought=
 along the sum of u.s$12.5 million , in a metallic box and presently in a s=
ecurity company as family valuables .=20
=20
My aim of contacting you is to seek for your able assistance as a front in =
transferring this fund abroad into an  account , then as a business develop=
er , you can help us to invest wisely in areas you deem lucrative and final=
ly obtain a residential permit for us to stay comfortable in your country o=
f abode .=20
=20
Presently we cannot go back to Sierra- Leone because of the situation there=
 and you know that cote d' Ivoire where we are now is politically unstable;=
 we therefore wish you could help us get out of here before it become worse=
.=20
=20
We are prepared to offer you 10% of the total funds for your able assistanc=
e and support and would send you proofs of the funds as soon as we favourab=
