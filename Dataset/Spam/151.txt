<body>My Dearest One ,<br />
<br />
It is my pleasure to contact you for a business venture which I am,intend to<br />
establish in your country. Though I have not met with you before but I<br />
believe, one has to risk confiding in someone to succeed sometimes in life.<br />
<br />
There is this amount of FIFTEEN Million US Dollars ($15.000.000.00) which <br />
my late grand father deposited with a security company in Abidjan Capital city of<br />
 Cote d'Ivoire which he wanted to used for his political ambition in our<br />
Country before he was assassinated. Now I have decided to invest this <br />
money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside Africa for<br />
security and political reasons.<br />
<br />
I want you to help me claim and receive the consignment which will be sent<br />
to you through diplomatic means to your address to avoid any traces of the<br />
funds and to enable you plan for the investment in your Country. I will like <br />
to invest part of the money into these three investments in your Country<br />
but, if there is any other business that is better than my suggestion, I will<br />
be very glad to follow your advice.<br />
<br />
1). Real estate<br />
2). The transport industry<br />
3). Five star hotel<br />
If you can be of an assistance to me i will be pleased to offer to you 20%<br />
Of the total fund while the balance will be invested by you. I await your<br />
soonest response. Kindly get back to me in my prive mail box (kouajo@hotmail.fr)<br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,<br />
Kouajo Aka</body>
