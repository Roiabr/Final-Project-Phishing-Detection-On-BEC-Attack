Dear Friend,
 
Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal Ethics.
 
I am Mr.Peter Ndab a staff in the accounts management Section of a well-known Bank here in South Africa.
 
One of our accounts with holding balance of $25,000,000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS) has been dormant 
and last operated in the past 3 years. From investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account
 is a Japanese Foreigner by name Engineer Meiji Iwatani died on the 4th of January 2001 in an 
automobile accident. Since then nobody has done anything as regards to the claiming of this money 
as he has no family member is aware of the existence of either the account or the fund.  Information 
from the National Immigration also states that late Engineer Meiji Iwatani was single on point of entry into South Africa.
 
I have confidentially discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and we have agreed to find a 
reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of 
kin of this fund from the deceased and fund released to you after due processes have been followed.
 
This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is Legitimate and does not originate from drug or money laundry.
 
On your interest, let me hear from you and please do not forget to include your contact details..
 
Regards,
PETER NDABA
