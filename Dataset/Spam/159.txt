ATTN: DIRECTOR/CEO.

I am MR ALBERT SITHOLI, the Bank Manager of Amalgamated Bank of South
Africa {ABSA}. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for
you. An American Gold Consultant/Contractor with the South African Solid
Gold Corporation, Mr. Glenn Hatleberg made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit
for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty Million
Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Solid
Gold Corporation that Glenn Hatleberg died in a plane crash in Alaska
Airlines Flight #261 (for more information about this crash and person,
you can contact this website:
http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/

Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, I
found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace
his next of Kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and
discovered that Mr. Glenn Hatleberg did not declare any Kin or relations
in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my
Bank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of
Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 6 (SIX) years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the next of kin to Mr. Glenn Hatleberg so that the fruits of this
old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your
full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary
documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of Kin. We
shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of
the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
Probate/Administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in
any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as the Beneficiary/next of Kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me
and 30% for you, then 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that we may
incur during transactions.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please
reply immediately via the private Fax and Phone numbers below. Upon your
response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me
your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. And
kindly observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

My private Phone +27-73-400-4485 or Fax +27-11-507-5946.  I wait for your
quick response.

Kindest regards,

ALBERT SITHOLI.
