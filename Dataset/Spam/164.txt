JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.

Dear Friend,
  
Let 
me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Paul Baloyi An Executive 
Director of my bank
Bank, DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SOUTHERN AFRICA (DBSA).I  
have an obscured business suggestion for you. One of our accounts with 
a holding balance of Money Valued $22,000,000.00 (Twenty-Two Million 
Dollars) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past six 
years.  
   
>From my investigations and confirmations, the  owner of 
this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a citizen of Germany who perished 
ina plane crash [Concorde Air Flight AF4590] with the whole 
passengers 
aboard on 31 July2000. And for your perusal you can view this web site:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm and  since then 
nobody has done anything as  regards the claiming of this money because 
he has no family members who are aware of the existence of the account 
nor the funds.

Also Information from the National Immigration stated 
that he was also single on entry into South Africa.
  
I have secretly 
discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to 
find a reliable foreign partner to deal with.
 
This transaction is 
totally risk and trouble free as the fund is legitimate and does not 
originate from drugs, money laundering, terrorism or any other illegal 
act. 
   
The sharing of the fund between us, is as follows; 40% of the 
total sum will go to you for 
your effort and commitment to the success 
of this transaction. 60% for me  and my colleague's. 
 
Best Regards, 

Mr Paul Baloyi
