Good Day ,
I know this proposal letter might be of pleasant surprised to you,
because i feel that we do not know ourselves very well, I am Mr.Ali

worthy person that can handle such a confidential transaction of this
nature, 
&nbsp;
My father (Late) DR Abdul Mohamed,
was the former Deputy Minister of Finance under the executive civilian
president of Liberia, but was ssassinated on the&nbsp;20Th July&nbsp;2004

decided to give you $3.4million of the
