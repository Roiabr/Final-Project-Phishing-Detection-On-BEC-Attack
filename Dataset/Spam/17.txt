Hello,

I am very sorry to embarrass you with this email as I did not mean to intrud=
e
in your privacy if not for the peculiar situation I have found myself. As yo=
u
read this, don't feel sorry for me, because it is the destiny of everyman to
die someday. I am Jaron Abbas a business merchant based in Scotland. I have
been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only abo=
ut
a few months to live, according to medical experts. I regret that I have not
particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not
even myself), but my trade. Though I am very well to do, I was never open
handed; I was always hostile to people and regarded them like they never had
hopes of becoming as successful as myself. Now I know that there is a lot mo=
re
to life than just prosperity.

I believe that when I am given a second chance to come to this world, I woul=
d
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that death is
imminent, I have willed and given most of my belongings to immediate and
extended family members, as well as a few close friends. I want God to be
merciful to me and accept my soul. Hence I have decided to support charity
work; this is what I want to be remembered for. So far, I have been able to
reach out to a few charity organizations in the Singapore, Algeria and
Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do =20
this myself
anymore.

I once asked members of my family to aid me in giving of alms to those
organizations catering for the less privileged in Bulgaria and Pakistan; the=
y
refused and kept the resources to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them
anymore, as they seem not to be contempt with what I have left for them.

The last of my belonging which no one knows of, is the huge deposit of Two
Million, Five Hundred Thousand US dollars that I have in a safe =20
keeping company
abroad, which I will want you to secure and bestow to charity organizations.

You can reach me on my email address jaron_abbass@yahoo.de
