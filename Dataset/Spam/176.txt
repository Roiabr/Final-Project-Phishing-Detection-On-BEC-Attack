Compliments Of The Season,
     Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and =
may offend your personality for contacting you without your prior consent a=
nd writing through this channel.I got your contact from the proffesional da=
ta base found in the internet Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for=
 a foreign reliable partner.I assured of your capability and reliability to=
 champion this business opportunity.

     After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contact you=
 among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I believe th=
at God has a way of helping who is in need.

   I am (Ben Coroma),the Head of file Department in African development ban=
k (ADB).
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dolla=
rs ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of =
our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st =
July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we h=
ave been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because=
 we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or rela=
tion to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunat=
ely we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side=
 with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is the=
refore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now dec=
ided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as =
the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbu=
rsement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t want this money to go =
into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here=
 stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after eight years, the mo=
ney will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The reque=
st of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact t=
hat the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of k=
in to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as forei=
gn partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be s=
et aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me a=
nd my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disburseme=
nt according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediat=
e transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the ban=
k as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, yo=
ur bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and =
effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon =
receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the a=
pplication I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is=
 hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all requi=
red arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me imm=
ediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you imme=
diately. Your=92s faithfully,  Ben Coroma.
