Compliments Of The Season,
     Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and =
may offend your personality for contacting you without your prior consent a=
nd writing through this channel.I got your contact from the proffesional da=
ta base found in the internet Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for=
 a foreign reliable partner.I assured of your capability and reliability to=
 champion this business opportunity.
=20
     After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contact you=
 among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I believe th=
at God has a way of helping who is in need.

   I am (Ben Coroma),the Head of file Department in African development ban=
k (ADB).
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dolla=
rs ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of =
our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st =
July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we h=
ave been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because=
 we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or rela=
tion to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunat=
ely we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side=
 with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is the=
refore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now dec=
ided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as =
the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbu=
rsement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t want this money to go =
into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here=
 stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after eight years, the mo=
ney will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The reque=
st of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact t=
hat the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of k=
in to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as forei=
gn partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be s=
et aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me a=
nd my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disburseme=
nt according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediat=
e transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the ban=
k as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, yo=
ur bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and =
effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon =
receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the a=
pplication I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is=
 hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all requi=
red arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me imm=
ediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you imme=
diately. Your=92s faithfully,  Ben Coroma.

Dear Sir,=0D

With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this=0D
proposal believing that it will receive the most=0D

previous correspondence, Although, I am constrained by=0D
insufficient information about you, but I will express=0D
in full the main objectives of this proposal .=0D
 =0D
I am Mr.CHRIS ANDERSON Personal Aide and in-law to the=0D
former President of the Liberian Mr. Charles Taylor,=0D
who resigned his post due to pressure from the=0D
International Community in order to maintain peace in=0D
west African Region. His Excellency who is currently=0D
behind bars at a U.N.-backed court in Hague=0D
Netherlands, facing 11 counts of war crimes during the=0D
country's 1991-2002 civil war. Liberian Government In=0D
conjunction with Sierra Leone Government has agreed on=0D
June 20, 2006 for security reason to Hand him over to=0D
U.N War crime Special Court in Hague, Netherlands.=0D
 =0D
His Excellency who was arrested on a boarder between=0D
Nigeria  and Cameroun of which he instructed me to=0D
escape with all his vital documents so that he could=0D
face a U.N.-backed tribunal for war crime charges=0D
which he is now currently facing. but before this new=0D
unfolding events. Though our original plan was after=0D
successful crossing to Cameroun un-noticed, I will=0D
proceed to Accra Ghana totake the task of arranging=0D
for the immediate evacuation of the money in whish he=0D
deposited in the custody of Security Finance Company=0D
before it will be discovered by International=0D
Community or Liberian Government.See the website for=0D

the period while he is in jail, on the terms as shall=0D
be agreed by both parties. The new government in=0D
Liberia lead by Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sir leaf has=0D
initiated moves to probe Mr. Taylor=92s governance while=0D
in office with a view of recovering his assets and=0D
deposits and repatriating such to the country as was=0D
the case with the Late Head of State of the Federal=0D
Republic of Nigeria, Gen. Sanni Abacha as advised by=0D
the International Community on Liberian Government.=0D
 =0D
On the wake of hostilities in Liberia and the break=0D
out of war between the rebels and the allied forces,=0D
the Liberian government being under an arms embargo by=0D
the U.N could not import arms officially, so Mr.=0D
Taylor resolved to illegal arms deal from the West=0D
African Region of Ghana, which was transacted by cash=0D
monies, within this period, he succeeded in depositing=0D
a total sumof USD$115M only, in cash money derived=0D
from the arms dealing custody of Security Finance=0D
Company in Accra Ghana. Which is the trust company=0D
from where the arms deal was financed?=0D
 =0D
we intends to execute a deed of conveyance of this=0D
deposit to a capable and trust worthy firm or=0D
individual who will immediately effect a change of=0D
beneficiary on the deposit and release it from the=0D
custody of Security Finance Company by way of=0D
terminating the deposit contract to avoid any trace=0D
and repatriation of the deposit by the new government=0D
in Liberia.=0D
 =0D
Terms of the transaction shall be discussed and=0D
agreement entered into when you indicate your ability=0D
to handle and manage funds of this magnitude under a=0D
strict confidential understanding..=0D
Please treat as most confidential due to the sensitive=0D
