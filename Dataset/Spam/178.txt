MY SECOND MAIL TO YOU.

Dear Sir / Madam,

I am Mr.Azzam Mahmud, Chairman of the Tender Committee in one of the leading 
oil company. My Committee is principally concerned with payment of all 
contract awarded from 2004 to date, in order of priority as regard capital 
projects of our corporation.

I am positive and convince that you would provide us with solution to a money 
transfer deal valued at US$13 Million (Thirteen Million United States 
Dollars) and subsequently a joint business venture. I will need bank account 
in your country or offshore account.

I would like to invest the money in manufacturing of products such as 
Household products, Electronic goods, Apparel and Textiles, Real Estate, 
Properties or Telecommunication in your country. If you have any other idea 
of investment, that would be welcomed by me. 

In the course of our duties as values, and project inspectors for the on-
going liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project, we have over-invoiced the value of 
some jobs done by foreign contractors to the tune of US$13Million.

As follows: -
(1) Computer optimization and Installation 4,000.000.00.
(2) Installation of 250,000.00 Monax Turbine$6,000.000.00
(3) Turn around Maintenance $3,000,000.00

The money will be shared as follows after transfer, 30% for you 70%  for me.

I know exactly how to present you / your company as the Beneficiary of the 
funds.

Yours Faithfully,
Mr.Azzam Mahmud.
