ATTN: CEO/DIRECTOR,
 
Sir/Madam,
 
I am Mr. Colin Shand The first son of Late Engineer Solomon Shand, of
Bulawayo-Zimbabwe. 
I and my mother are now resident in South Africa as an Asylum seeker

some huge amount of money, which I inherited from my dead father few
months ago.
 
My father s tragedy occurred when the Zimbabwean government took our
farm from us. My father was murdered in Zimbabwean and I and my mother
are
the only people left in the family, so I am willing to leave South Africa
for any place abroad. My fund is presently deposited with a Security
Company without disclosing the contents of the box to the Security Firm,
and I would like you to 
 
Help me transfer this money overseas pending investment. The amount
deposited is (Twenty-Two Million United States Dollars) US$22 Million.
In consideration of your assistance, I agreed to offer you, upon
acceptance to this proposal 30% the remaining 70% will be for me and my
mother for our life investment in your country.
 
If you are interested and willing to assist me, you should please forward
to me your following information so that I can reach you:
 
1) YOUR FULL NAMES 
2) YOUR PHYSICAL/POSTAL ADDRESSES
3) YOUR PRIVATE TEL, FAX AND MOBILE PHONE NUMBERS
4) YOUR DATE OF BIRTH
5) YOUR MARITAL STATUS
 
The confidentiality of this proposal will be highly appreciated.
 
Thanks as I await your urgent response.
 
Best Regards,
Mr. Colin Shand
