CAN . OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO. WEST AFRICA Dear  , how are you,first i wi=
ll explain my self in brief for you before we proceed.I am the manager of b=
ill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of BANK OF AFRICAN (B=
OA)  I am writing to Seek your interest over a business , In my department =
we discovered an abandoned sum of $15.5m US dollars (fifteen million five U=
S dollars). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who d=
ied along with his entire family in November 15th 2001 in a plane crash at =
abidjan cote'voire. Since we  got information about his death, we have been=
 expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cann=
ot release it unless his next of kin or relative applies for it as next of =
kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but =
unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died =
along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.=
 It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in my d=
epartment now  decided to excape with the fund,and as such we vial to make =
this business proposal to you so that my bank will release the fund into yo=
ur account as the next of kin to our bank deceased customer for safety and =
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for claims and we don't want=
 this money to go into the bank treasury. Infact i know the fund will not e=
ven go into the bank treasury,but our top bank officials(directors)will onl=
y share it among themselves into their accounts. The Banking law and guidel=
ine here in burkina faso stipulates that if any customer account or propert=
y remains unserviceable or dormant,and unclaimed after five years, the acco=
unt will be confiscated and transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed =
bill. The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasion=
ed by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot sta=
nd as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be f=
or you as foreign partner,inrespect to the provision of a foreign account,a=
nd your imense contribution to champion the course of transfering the fund =

 after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement accordi=
ng to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable my bank transfer the f=
und into your account,i will send to you the text of application which you =
