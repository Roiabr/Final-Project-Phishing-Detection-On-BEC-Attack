NOTIFICATION OF BEQUEST
 
On behalf of the Trustees and Executor of the estate of Late
Engr.Lurther Klein, I once again try to notify you as my
earlier letter returned undelivered. Late Engr. Lurther Klein left
the sum of seven million five hundred thousand
United States Dollars ($7,500.000.00 USD) to you in the codicil 
and last testament to his WILL.
 
This may sound unbelievable to you, but it is true.
