It is a great honour to write you, after several hesistation.I do not want to say much, but My Name Is K I Bakri, i will definitely tell you more about myself and we get to know each other definitely once i get your reply. I have been diagnosed with Ideopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, which is a terminal disease ,and i have no chance of surviving. I am writing you for your cooperation in fufilling a last wish i have, as i lay on my death bed.
My wish is distributing my last wealth which i have kept in a diplomatic box with a security company.The Diploamtic box contains a huge sum of money, i would reveal to you later, i want you to stand on my behalf and collect the box and help in the distribution of the wealth to the less priviledged.
I expect your response if you can perform this task, as there are several people dying and suffering all over the world abd i feel that my widows mite can change things a little..
Â 
So, How can you help the less priviledged with my funds?
Can i count on you?

Best Wishes
K I Bakri
