 From . Mr. Moreno Garcia.

Date: 21 - 06 -2007.

Kindest Attention:

My name is Mr. Moreno Garcia. I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed wi=
th
Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and =20
right now
I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have
not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for =20
anyone (not
even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I
was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the
only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there i=
s
more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I
believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I =20
would live my
life a different way from how I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and
assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few =20
close friends
  .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have =20
decided to give
alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want this to be one of
the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to some
charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health has deteriorated s=
o
badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to
close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there =20
to charity
organization in United States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and
kept the money to themselves.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with wh=
at
I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000, 000.00) that=
 I
have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I will want you to
help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations and us=
e
it to help those in Need.

N/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami,
Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other
Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am usin=
g
my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-ma=
il
if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.

God be with you.

Mr. Moreno Garcia.
