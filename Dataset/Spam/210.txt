Beloved,

I am sorry for my unannounced communication with you especially through this =
common method but I promise to give you more reasons for this in due course.

I am Nopparat Sujaritpinij from Thailand (nopparat.sujaritpinij@worker.com). =
I worked with Terry Ford 51, a white farmer in Zimbabwe till his sudden death =
in March, 2002. My boss, Terry Ford was a rich commercial and successful =
farmer in Zimbabwe till the land reforms of Mugabe led government which =
exposed many white farmers to the brutality of the black "war veterans" who =
in one of their attacks shot and killed him.

In case you are not familiar with this incident, you can look it up in any =
international news media like; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1878846.stm =
, http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2002/03/18/zimbabwe020318.html.

Well, I am contacting you in respect of a deposited fund which is to the tone =
of us$16 million which was meant for the purchase of farm tools and =
accessories. Since his death, I have thought of a way forward but with the =
continuous stay of the funds with bank, the government may trace it which =
means a total lost hence I arranged for the withdrawal.

I successfully withdrew the funds and re-deposited it with a private security =
company as a family treasure. As it is, I am well informed about farming and =
could do any other business as well but all I need now is a partner to help =
me in settling down this funds in any account(s) be it personal or company's =
account.

Please, is rest assured that it is between me and you and so shall I like it =
to remain. Again, the funds in question as it is has nothing whatsoever to do =
with Zimbabwe any longer as I urge you to feel free in dealing with me as no =
risk is involved.

In dealing with you, I am ready to compensate your efforts with 17% of the =
total funds while 3% will be to reimburse any form of expenses from your side =
otherwise, we can work on partnership in all investments.

I will wait to hear from you as I will be ever ready to supply you with every =
details of myself as well as that of the transaction.

Regards,

Nopparat Sujaritpinij
