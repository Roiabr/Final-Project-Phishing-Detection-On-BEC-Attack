Dear Friend,  Permit the manner with which I am seeking your assistance but=
 I am short of options and have no other choice. I am Jonathan Charles from=
 the hospitality state ( Mississippi ), an army contractor attached to the =
US Military force in Iraq . The reason why I=92m contacting you is to expla=
in my findings to you and to seek for your assistance to enable you contrib=
utes immensely to the actualization of my dream.  =20
I am attached to the US army for the sole purpose of reconstruction work in=
 some parts of Iraq . As you know very well Iraq is gradually undergoing a =
rebuilding process in some parts and there is much need for reconstruction =
which was why I was invited. I evaluate the level of destruction and offer =
professional advice in line with the way they intend rebuilding and reconst=
ructing damaged facilities. Work has been risky no doubt and challenging as=
 sometimes we are faced hard on with armed insurgents where we lose some so=
ldiers during confrontation. I have had my own share of losses as I lost a =
friend whom I have known for 12 years. On the 27th day of March 2007, at ab=
out 11:00 hrs during a normal inspection routine along Haifa Street where t=
here is long rough high-rise buildings which were built and occupied by the=
 late Saddam Hussein when he was alive, I with other 3 soldiers proceeded t=
o a marked site and as I commenced evaluation work while I was closely guid=
ed by soldiers, I discovered an unusual bulge in a cellar which I presumed =
to be a storage room, I decided to have a look at it, only for me to kick t=
he metal covering and find a metal boxes (5 in number) piled on top one ano=
ther which were locked with a padlock each with a sign written in each of t=
hem.  Upon forcing the boxes open, we discovered several guns, amour and so=
me boxes amongst which two contained guns and bullets, one filled with hard=
 drugs (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contained some US Dollar=
s and kilograms of alluvial Gold, which we counted and discovered that the =
money in one of the boxes amounted to $9.2 Million. I believe the boxes own=
ed and linked to the Al Qaeda and Ayman al-Zawahiri. I however instructed t=
hem to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have the money and alluvial=
 Gold to our selves, they all agreed to the plan of getting the money out o=
f the country, but first we had to hide the money and alluvial Gold in some=
 safe and untraceable location. We secretly kept the boxes in a safer place=
 after which we handed over the drugs and the weapons to our superiors.=20
I am now in desperate need of a =93Reliable and Trustworthy=94 person like =
you who would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dol=
lars and alluvial Gold for me until my assignment elapses here. We cannot a=
fford to leave the boxes here in Iraq for any reason since Iraq is getting =
unsafe and dangerous everyday. We have no idea what could happen next as ev=
erything remains inconclusive at this point. I am fully aware of what your =
thoughts would be next, but on receiver of your response, I will send my pi=
cture as well as my Identity, for you to know whom you are dealing with. I =
assure and promise to give you 15% of this fund and some quantity of the al=
luvial Gold, please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret within yo=
u so that my job would not be jeopardized.  My Sincere Regards,Jonathan Cha=
