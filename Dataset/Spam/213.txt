ATTENTION: DIRECTOR /CEO.


STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me
personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVID PEDRO ,the
first SON of MR.MASIARA PEDRO, a member of commercial farmers union and leader movement for democratic change (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.
I was furnished with viable information from the International Trade Centre
here in Johannesburg and I decided to write to you. Before the death of my
father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$17 M(SEVENTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, as if he fore saw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the
farms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem
came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new 
Land Act which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact, a lot of people have been killed 
because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims.
It is against this background, that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.

I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in 
South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future since 
both countries have similar political history. Moreover, the South African 
Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment as an asylum seeker. 
As a business man, whom I have entrusted my future and of my family in his 
hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept 
to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the money into any
account you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into 
partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your 
country. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I have 
also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the 
process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above telephone number while I 
Implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending a reply. Please, you should keep this transaction secret and confidential. contact  me on this  mail direct  email:davpe@myway.com

And send your fax and telephone numbers for easy communication/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following:
1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.
2) YOUR FULL NAME.
3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.
PLEASE YOU CAN READ ABOUT PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE AND HOW MY FATHER DIED,
