From: Mr Usman Zongo African Development Bank (ADB)Ouagadougou , Burkina Fa=
so .  Dear Friend, I Am The Manager Of Foreign Remittance And Exchange Dept=
 At African Development Bank (ADB). Burkina- Faso, West Africa . In my depa=
rtment we discover an abandoned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve Million, S=
ix Hundred Thousand Us Dollar). In an account that belongs to one of our fo=
reign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a plane crash t=
he year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board. Since we =
got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of k=
in to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unle=
ss someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as ind=
icating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his =
supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account information d=
ied alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the cla=
im.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this busi=
ness proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of =
kin or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do =
not want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill o=
r fund. The bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remai=
ned unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank =
treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin=
 in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a fore=
igner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.In subsequen=
t disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you=
 in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as next of k=
in,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the transaction on ta=
xes that will arise and 50% would be for me.As soon as the money hit into y=
our account I will come over to your country for disbursement according to =
the percentages indicated above. To make the claim, you will first of all a=
pply to the bank by sending a text of application which I will send to you =
for you to fill and send to the bank. In the application you will indicate =
your bank account, your private fax and your private telephone number for e=
asy and effective communication. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to=
 you by email the text of application which you will send to the bank. I wi=
ll not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and=
 you do not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have be=
en made for the success of the transfer. You should contact me immediately =
as soon as you receive this letter. Hoping to hear from you immediately. Th=
anks.Usman Zongo
