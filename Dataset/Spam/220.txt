                         ("REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS         =
                          CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE")
Compliments Of The Season 2007,    Forgive my indignation if this message c=
omes to you as a surprise and may offend your personality for contacting yo=
u without your prior consent and writing through this channel.I got your co=
ntact from the proffesional data base found in the internet Yahoo tourist s=
earch.When i was searching For a foreign reliable partner.
I assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees oppo=
rtunity.  After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contac=
t you among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I belie=
ve that God has a way of helping who is in need.
I am (MUSTAFA BRUNU  Esq),the Head of file Department in BANK OF AFRICA (BO=
A). In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A d=
ollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one=
 of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (July 21,=
 2003) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have =
been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we =
cannot =B5 release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or rela=
tive on to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines,
But unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation d=
ied alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the cla=
im. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my depar=
tment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the mo=
ney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and su=
bsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t want thi=
s money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained u=
nclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasu=
ry as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this busin=
ess is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner,and a Burki=
nabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this=
 money will be for you as foreign partner,in respect to the provision of a =
foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the bus=
iness and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will v=
isit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.
Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund  as arranged, you m=
ust apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased ind=
icating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone an=
d fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the mo=
ney will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax =
or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notic=
e that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any=
 atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.
You should contact me on my number +226-76 54 93 42. immediately as soon as=
 you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.Your=92s fa=
ithfully,MUSTAFA BRUNU  (Esq.)
FROM (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.GOD BLESSINGS,PROTECTIONS AND GUIDIAN=
CE TO YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as=
 to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will pr=
