<div>Dear Beloved,</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I am Mrs.Ganeshwary Ajith Kumar  from the war torn district of Jaffna in Sri Lanka{which i suppose you know about}  with my 6 year old son. I am married to a contractor here  who happened to loose his life in the war zone because he is opposed to the rebel group. Since the death of my husband and my 15 year old daughter things have not been thesame.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We managed to get ourselves in the Chavakachcheri division of Jaffna peninsula where we have been in a camp with more or less to eat and drink. I have been making some arrangement to leave here with my son and relocate to another country but it is not easy because i have no money with me. I have a consignment which contains cash and other valuables that my late husband always told me about that he deposited in a security firm in Europe which i will require your assistance to get so that i could make haste and  leave this war torn zone. I really need the content of this consignment because for you to get out of here safely you have to pay heavy money to the rebels so that they will guide you safely to a safe zone and i have nothing on me to do that that is why i contacted you to assist me get the consignment so that i could make arrangements to leave this place.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>At the moment my only means of communication is through my late husband's laptop which i have with me here {because there is free internet connection around here} as we do not have access to telephone and are afriad of leaving this camp because of constant shelling and fighting outside. Please i will like you to assist me to have a safe and better life and also for many more others that are here whom i want to help get out of here too.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I will inform you more when i hear from you.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>God Bless</div>
