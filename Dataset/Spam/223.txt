Dear Friend,
I am Abdul Faye {ESQ} a solicitor, financial adviser/Attorney to Mr.  
James Cole, who lived in Senegal. On 14th of Feb 1997, my client was  
involved in a car accident Along Place Independence Road, Senegal, All  
occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I  
have been trying to locate any of his relative or Next of Kin, but to  
no avail, After all unsuccessful attempts to locate any of his  
relatives, I decided to contact you to assist in repatriating the  
money left behind by my client before they get confiscated by the  
security company where this huge deposit($21million), was fixed. I  
want you to send me your full name, address, private telephone/fax  
number for easy communication and more details will be furnish to you.

Regards,
