Dear Friend 
It is my prayers that in any time in your life that you need help, God  himself will come to your aid.  Before continuing, I do like to inform  you  that this transaction is a  risk  free. It is completely risk free. The money inquestion I want to  transfer  into your bank account is my inheritance from my late father. 
It  is a  legally acquired money so there is nothing wrong about it.  Because,Before  the death of my father in the united kingdom, He sincerely  called me on  his bed side  and  told me that he had a sum of Eight million  Three 
hundred   thousand United state Dollars ($8,300,000 US DOLLARS)  kept in  a local bank here in the united kingdom.He also used his name  to  Deposit the  money,and me  as his only daughter as next of kin/heir.i am the only 
survival of the  family as my mum died 3 years before my dad of child  birth. 
Like I told you in my mail, I am alone now. I want to transfer the  money  into your bank account after which, I shall travel to meet with  you  in  your  country so that we can invest the money in lucrative  businesses. I 
am  only  21 years now and I do not have any experience of investment.  I am  hoping on  you to make the investment. Last week, I went to the bank  here  where  the  money was deposited to inform them that I want them to  release 
the  money to  me. The bank people told me that their was an agreement  with  my late  father during the time of deposit that the money will not be  given or release  to me  until I am at least 24 years of age. Now that I am 
not up  to 24 years,  the  bank said that I have to appoint another person who  will  act as my 
guardian  so that they will release and transfer the money directly to  the  person. The  bank said that the person that I will appoint must be a  least  24 years  or  above. This is the reason why I have contacted you  urgently to 
help me  receive the money. The second reason is that my father who was  poisoned  by  his own family before his death told me to transfer the  money  to a bank  account of a person of my choice abroad and leave this  country 
immediately  and also the crises here is getting worse and never  subsides. I  do not  know   any one that I can contact this is reason why I have  requested you to  help  me. 
My dear It is true that we do not know each other before now, I believe  that  we can work with one another and become a very reliable partners.  I   know for  sure that both of us will handle this transaction to a mutual 
benefit.   once  I hear and concluded with you, I shall give you the  contact  of the bank  here  so that you can contact the bank as my guardian and  request for urgent  transfer of this fund to your account.   The bank is already aware that I should appoint some one and they have 
been  waiting for me to give them the name of the person. The bank will  work  directly with you and will release the money directly to you. Once the  money  is released, the bank will transfer the money into any account 
that  you  will  donate. 
This means that you will need to provide a bank account where the money  will  be transferred into. it does not matter if there is money in the  account or  not. All the bank needs is a valid account that can receive  the  money  when  it is transferred. Once the money is transferred into the  account that  you  shall donate, you shall send me some money back here  so  that I can  arrange  for my traveling documents . I hope to meet with  you  one week from the  time  that the money have been transferred into your  bank  account.  Concerning the reason why I choosed you, I will like to tell  you  how it  happened. I do not know who I was going to appoint as my  guardian.  Now  the  time is running and I am getting more confused. I starting  asking God  for  directives on that. On day, I decided that I was going to  look for   people   contacts and profile and select any one that my mind told me 
to  pick. I  went  to an internet center here in the united kingdom were I  present live and  started  searching on the internet. I got a lot of contact but I copied  only   three  and took it home. When I got home, I kept the names and was  praying  on  it so  that God  will direct me. 
I was afraid but a last, I had this aasuring in my spirit that God will  never let me down as an orphan. On the last day, I was led by my spirit  to  take you among the three names. I did not waste time but contacted  you  the  next day. I trust you but I trust God the more because he will 
never  fail me  nor leave me. From you mail too, I am sure you are the right  person  for  me.  I am compelled to even trust someone that I do not know  because I 
do  not  have any choice.  I hope that this mail have explained so well  and  if you need to know  anymore  thing, do not hesitate to ask me so that I can answer. When I  receive  your  next reply. I will leave you here and until I hear from 
you, 
I  remain.You

Dear Friend,
I am Abdul Faye {ESQ} a solicitor, financial adviser/Attorney to Mr.  
James Cole, who lived in Senegal. On 14th of Feb 1997, my client was  
involved in a car accident Along Place Independence Road, Senegal, All  
occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I  
have been trying to locate any of his relative or Next of Kin, but to  
no avail, After all unsuccessful attempts to locate any of his  
relatives, I decided to contact you to assist in repatriating the  
money left behind by my client before they get confiscated by the  
security company where this huge deposit($21million), was fixed. I  
want you to send me your full name, address, private telephone/fax  
number for easy communication and more details will be furnish to you.

Regards,
Barrister Abdul Faye.

CAPITEC BANK LTD.
ROODEPOORT BRANCH,
JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.
Private Email:a_chriss36@yahoo.gr


Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Chris Adriaan credit officer
of Capitec Bank Ltd.I have a concealed business suggestion for you.
Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Mr. Hassian Hussein who was an
Iraqi Business Man and also Deals On Arms With The South African
Government made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a
value of Nineteen million five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only
($19.5m) in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to him,
even during the war, again after the war several notifications were sent
and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Mr.
Hassian Hussein and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb
blast that hit their home in Iraq.
After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Hassian
Hussein did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including
the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my
bank. So, Nineteen million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is
still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What
bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the
expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the South
African Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Hassian Hussein so that you
will be able to receive his funds.
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall
come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Hassian
Hussein, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide
me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his
job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill
in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter
of probate/Administration in your favor for the movement of the funds to
an account that will be provided by you.
There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a
legalized method and the Attorney will prepare all the necessary
documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your
nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for
you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation.
Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers
for easy communication, you can write me via my private box and i will
provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to
this letter will be appreciated. Kindly send your reply to:
a_chriss36@yahoo.gr

Kind Regards,

Mr. Chris Adriaan.

<div>Dear Beloved,</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I am Mrs.Ganeshwary Ajith Kumar  from the war torn district of Jaffna in Sri Lanka{which i suppose you know about}  with my 6 year old son. I am married to a contractor here  who happened to loose his life in the war zone because he is opposed to the rebel group. Since the death of my husband and my 15 year old daughter things have not been thesame.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We managed to get ourselves in the Chavakachcheri division of Jaffna peninsula where we have been in a camp with more or less to eat and drink. I have been making some arrangement to leave here with my son and relocate to another country but it is not easy because i have no money with me. I have a consignment which contains cash and other valuables that my late husband always told me about that he deposited in a security firm in Europe which i will require your assistance to get so that i could make haste and  leave this war torn zone. I really need the content of this consignment because for you to get out of here safely you have to pay heavy money to the rebels so that they will guide you safely to a safe zone and i have nothing on me to do that that is why i contacted you to assist me get the consignment so that i could make arrangements to leave this place.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>At the moment my only means of communication is through my late husband's laptop which i have with me here {because there is free internet connection around here} as we do not have access to telephone and are afriad of leaving this camp because of constant shelling and fighting outside. Please i will like you to assist me to have a safe and better life and also for many more others that are here whom i want to help get out of here too.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I will inform you more when i hear from you.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>God Bless</div>

I am (MUSTAFA BRUNU  Esq),the Head of file Department in BANK OF AFRICA (BO=

 of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (July 21,=
 2003) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have =

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained u=
nclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasu=

 money will be for you as foreign partner,in respect to the provision of a =
foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the bus=
iness and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will v=

My name is Sandra Williams from United Kingdom, I am 18 years old. My letter might come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not meet in person for the first time or even being in correspondence before, but I believe it takes just a day to know some either physically or by correspondence. I believe that it takes a day to know some one either physically or by correspondence. I got your email address from the internet and decided to seek for your urgent assistance as I am having a big problem with my stepmother since after the death of my father. 

some months ago my father died from Heart operation. I am making this contact to you in respect of 10, 000,000.00 British Pounds, which I inherited from my late father. My late father was an  International OIL dealer. My problem actually started when my stepmother called me and said that I must submit to her and her Children the deposit Certificate of 10, 000,000.00 British Pounds, 
which my late father gave me as a proof that he really deposited the money in a bank, I refused to submit the Deposit Certificate to them because the money was legally "WILLED" to me by my late father before he died, but out of greediness they want to use intimidation to take away the Deposit Certificate from me and then claim the money on their own.

since the death of my father, my stepmother and her Children has being Threatening to kill me if I do not give them the Deposit Certificate of the 10, 000,000.00 British Pounds, which I  inherited from my late father for my future survival. They seized my International passport and bit hell out of me because of the Deposit Certificate, but I refused to surrender the Deposit  Certificate to them because they also inherited majority of my late father's wealth including his companies. Their desire is to frustrate my life because I don't use to be in good terms with them because of past history concerning the death of my mother, I was told that my stepmother used her friend to poison my mother in other to become the only wife, so because of the story I heard  about the death of my mother, I ran away from the family house in other to protect the deposit certificate and my life from my wicked stepmother and her Children whose desire is to take away  my legal right and let me go as
tray. 

Now, I need as urgent as possible a reliable and trustworthy foreigner who can receive this money for me in his or her country pending when I will arrange another International passport to  visit the person in his or her country for investment as I wish to run away from the country in other to secure my life from my wicked stepmother and her children who are now hunting me like a  prey. I wish to run to another country and settle down with the money as they use to say that prevention is better than cure, so I wish to protect my life for better tomorrow. At the present  time, I am in a hiding place arranging myself for traveling outside the country.

If you can help me in this my time of sorrow, I promise to reward you with 20% of the total sum, while 80% will be kept for me into your personal bank account pending my arrival to your country. Please help me to safe guide my only hope for survival. I am looking forward for your sincere and honest assistance to me. Reply to my private E-Mail Address: s_williams1989@yahoo.com.hk 

Sincerely,
Sandra.

FROM: DAVID PEDRO.
NO.1023 MATIMA STREET
FREE STATE, SOUTH AFRICA
TEL: +27.785709710
EMAIL: davpe@myway.com

ATTENTION: DIRECTOR /CEO.


STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me
personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVID PEDRO ,the
first SON of MR.MASIARA PEDRO, a member of commercial farmers union and leader movement for democratic change (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.
I was furnished with viable information from the International Trade Centre
here in Johannesburg and I decided to write to you. Before the death of my
father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$17 M(SEVENTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, as if he fore saw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the
farms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem
came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new 
Land Act which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact, a lot of people have been killed 
because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims.
It is against this background, that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.

I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in 
South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future since 
both countries have similar political history. Moreover, the South African 
Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment as an asylum seeker. 
As a business man, whom I have entrusted my future and of my family in his 
hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept 
to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the money into any
account you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into 
partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your 
country. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I have 
also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the 
process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above telephone number while I 
Implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending a reply. Please, you should keep this transaction secret and confidential. contact  me on this  mail direct  email:davpe@myway.com

And send your fax and telephone numbers for easy communication/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following:
1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.
2) YOUR FULL NAME.
3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.
PLEASE YOU CAN READ ABOUT PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE AND HOW MY FATHER DIED,

Dear Friend,  Permit the manner with which I am seeking your assistance but=
 I am short of options and have no other choice. I am Jonathan Charles from=
 the hospitality state ( Mississippi ), an army contractor attached to the =
US Military force in Iraq . The reason why I=92m contacting you is to expla=
in my findings to you and to seek for your assistance to enable you contrib=
utes immensely to the actualization of my dream.  =20
I am attached to the US army for the sole purpose of reconstruction work in=
 some parts of Iraq . As you know very well Iraq is gradually undergoing a =
rebuilding process in some parts and there is much need for reconstruction =
which was why I was invited. I evaluate the level of destruction and offer =
professional advice in line with the way they intend rebuilding and reconst=
ructing damaged facilities. Work has been risky no doubt and challenging as=
 sometimes we are faced hard on with armed insurgents where we lose some so=
ldiers during confrontation. I have had my own share of losses as I lost a =
friend whom I have known for 12 years. On the 27th day of March 2007, at ab=
out 11:00 hrs during a normal inspection routine along Haifa Street where t=
here is long rough high-rise buildings which were built and occupied by the=
 late Saddam Hussein when he was alive, I with other 3 soldiers proceeded t=
o a marked site and as I commenced evaluation work while I was closely guid=
ed by soldiers, I discovered an unusual bulge in a cellar which I presumed =
to be a storage room, I decided to have a look at it, only for me to kick t=

Beloved,

I am sorry for my unannounced communication with you especially through this =
common method but I promise to give you more reasons for this in due course.

I am Nopparat Sujaritpinij from Thailand (nopparat.sujaritpinij@worker.com). =
I worked with Terry Ford 51, a white farmer in Zimbabwe till his sudden death =
in March, 2002. My boss, Terry Ford was a rich commercial and successful =
farmer in Zimbabwe till the land reforms of Mugabe led government which =
exposed many white farmers to the brutality of the black "war veterans" who =
in one of their attacks shot and killed him.

In case you are not familiar with this incident, you can look it up in any =
international news media like; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1878846.stm =
, http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2002/03/18/zimbabwe020318.html.

Well, I am contacting you in respect of a deposited fund which is to the tone =
of us$16 million which was meant for the purchase of farm tools and =
accessories. Since his death, I have thought of a way forward but with the =
continuous stay of the funds with bank, the government may trace it which =
means a total lost hence I arranged for the withdrawal.

I successfully withdrew the funds and re-deposited it with a private security =
company as a family treasure. As it is, I am well informed about farming and =
could do any other business as well but all I need now is a partner to help =
me in settling down this funds in any account(s) be it personal or company's =
account.

Please, is rest assured that it is between me and you and so shall I like it =
to remain. Again, the funds in question as it is has nothing whatsoever to do =
with Zimbabwe any longer as I urge you to feel free in dealing with me as no =
risk is involved.

In dealing with you, I am ready to compensate your efforts with 17% of the =
total funds while 3% will be to reimburse any form of expenses from your side =
otherwise, we can work on partnership in all investments.

I will wait to hear from you as I will be ever ready to supply you with every =
details of myself as well as that of the transaction.

Regards,

Nopparat Sujaritpinij
nopparat.sujaritpinij@worker.com

 From . Mr. Moreno Garcia.

Date: 21 - 06 -2007.

Kindest Attention:

My name is Mr. Moreno Garcia. I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed wi=
th
Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and =20
right now
I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have
not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for =20
anyone (not
even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I
was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the
only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there i=
s
more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I
believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I =20
would live my
life a different way from how I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and
assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few =20
close friends
  .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have =20
decided to give
alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want this to be one of
the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to some
charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health has deteriorated s=
o
badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to
close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there =20
to charity
organization in United States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and
kept the money to themselves.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with wh=
at
I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000, 000.00) that=
 I
have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I will want you to
help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations and us=
e
it to help those in Need.

N/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami,
Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other
Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am usin=
g
my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-ma=
il
if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.

God be with you.

Mr. Moreno Garcia.

                  "MY GOOD WILL"

 

 

I greet you in the name of God Almighty. I am former Mrs. Saleh Galal, now I am Mrs. Mary Saleh Galal a widow to Late Dr. Mohamed Galal.

 

I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October 

1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:

(http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and my only daughter died in LONDON ATTACK BOMB.

 

My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America, Canada, Africa, Europe and Asian Countries.

 

This mission, who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $7,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country, and i have map out $1,700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work. 

 

Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore, I forward to you immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped.

 

Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity upon vanity.

 

I await your reply.

Mrs. Saleh Galal
