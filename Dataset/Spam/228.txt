=0D=0A=0D=0A       Dear:Sir/Madam,=0D=0A=0D=0AYou may be surprised to recei=
ve this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am Mr. Mazuri=
 Martins the first son of Mr.Philip Mazuri, who was recently murdered in th=
e land dispute in Zimbabwe .I got your contact through the internet network=
 online hence I decided to write you.=0D=0A=0D=0ABefore the death of my fat=
her, he travelled to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$ 25.5Million (Tw=
enty Five  Million Five  Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only, in o=
ne of the private security/finance companies, as if he foresaw the looming =
danger in Zimbabwe  .  This money was deposited in the security / finance c=
ompany as family valuables and consignment to avoid much demurrage from the=
 Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines/ =
farm machineries and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new far=
m   in Swaziland because he is the chairman of the farmers association whil=
e Mum was the treasurer.     This land problem came ( and is still on )  wh=
en our President Mr. Robert  Mugabe introduced a new Land Act reform which =
wholly affected the rich white farmers  and some few black  farmers. This r=
esulted to the killing and mob action by the Zimbabwean war veterans and so=
me lunatics in the society hijacked the opportunity.  In fact, lot of peopl=
e were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one=
 of the victims, the news about the crisis in Zimbabwe is every where both =
in the CNN and BBC.=0D=0A=0D=0AIt is against this background that, I and my=
 family  who are currently staying in South Africa now decided to transfer =
my father's money to a foreign country since the law of South Africa prohib=
its refugees(political asylum seekers)  to open any bank  account or to be =
involved in any financial  transaction throughout the  territorial zones of=
 South Africa.  As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the respo=
nsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner with a good bank account whe=
re this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my governm=
ent who are bent on taking everything.      All I seek for is your seriousn=
ess, for I am entrusting my future and that of my family into your hands .I=
 must also let you know that this transaction is 100%risk free.  If you acc=
ept to assist my family and me all I want from you is for you to make arran=
gements and come to Johannesburg - South Africa (if possible), so that you =
can help me   open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in=
   transferring the money into any account you will nominate outside South =
Africa . This money I intend to use for investment in a good business ventu=
re.  =0D=0AI have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certa=
