From:&nbsp;Mr Usman Zongo&nbsp;<BR>African Development Bank (ADB)<BR>Ouagad=
ougou , Burkina Faso . <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Dear Friend, <BR>I Am The Manager Of F=
oreign Remittance And Exchange Dept At African Development Bank (ADB). Burk=
ina- Faso, West Africa .<BR>&nbsp;<BR>In my department we discover an aband=
oned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve Million, Six Hundred Thousand Us Doll=
ar). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died alo=
ngside with his entire family in a plane crash the year 2001 that took the =
whole life of the passengers on board.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Since we got informatio=
n about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come ove=
r and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unless someone app=
lies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicating in our=
 banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next =
of kin or relation that knows about the account information died alongside =
with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.<BR>It is t=
herefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business propo=
sal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of kin or rel=
ation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do not want t=
his money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill or fund.<BR=
>&nbsp;<BR>The bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money re=
mained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the ba=
nk treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of =
kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a f=
oreigner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.<BR>In su=
bsequent disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be =
for you in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as ne=
xt of kin,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during&nbsp; the trans=
action on taxes that will arise and 50% would be for me.<BR>As soon as the =
money hit into your account I will come over to your country for disburseme=
nt according to the percentages indicated above.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>To make the c=
laim, you will first of all apply to the bank by sending a text of applicat=
ion which I will send to you for you to fill and send to the bank. In the a=
pplication you will indicate your bank account, your private fax and your p=
rivate telephone number for easy and effective communication.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>=
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of applica=
tion which you will send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your noti=
ce that this transaction is hitch free and you do not entertain any atom of=
 fear as all required arrangements have been made for the success of the tr=
ansfer. <BR>You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this l=
etter.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Hoping to hear from you immediately.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Thank=
s.<BR>Usman Zongo<BR><br /><hr />Get news, entertainment and everything you=
