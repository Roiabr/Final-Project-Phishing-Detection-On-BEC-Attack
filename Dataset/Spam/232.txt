,That gives me about 53 years plus my age of experience,I have just
founded my own orphan home  in just 2 years now in united kingdom At
it's height,our Quarries Village accommodated 1500  children at a
time.  In all, more than 30,000 children passed through Quarries
Village. Over 7000 migrated to Canada or Australia, and others  , we
need to raise over millions a year - through generous supporters who
donate their money,time or energy. These donations are crucial in
helping us improve people's lives and rise to the challenges of
society's changing needs. we have care  for the private and local
orphans from all around the world.I am always facing serious
difficulties when it comes to orphan in Americans.there are donation
all around the world  ,but They are always referring to pay with a US
POSTAL MONEY ORDER CASHIER CHECK ,which is difficult for me to cash
here in United Kingdom,I am looking for a representative in the
states who will be working form as a par time worker and i will be
willing to pay 10% for every transaction which wouldn't affect your
present state of works someone who would help me receive payments
from my customers in the United state of America,i mean someone that
is responsible and reliable,cause the cost of coming to the state and
getting payments is very expensive,i am working on setting up a
branch in the states,so for now i need a representative in the united
states who will be handling the payment aspect. These payments are in
money order , cashier check or and they would come to you in your
name, so all you need do is cash the money order deduct your
percentage and wire the rest back. But the problem i have is trust
These payments are in money order and they would come to you in your
name, so all you need do is cash the money order deduct your
percentage and wire the rest back. But the problem i have is
trust,But i have my way of getting any one that gets away with our

of a money order then u are to cash it and send the cash  to me via
western union money transfer or money gram money transfer,all
