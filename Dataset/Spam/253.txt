Dear Sir/Madam,

I am conducting a standard process investigation on behalf of our Bank an
international banking conglomerate. This investigation involves a client
and also the circumstances surrounding investments made by this client
with our
Bank.

Our client died intestate and nominated no successor in title over the
investments made with our bank. The essence of this communication with you
is to request you provide us information/comment on this issue so that I
can
use my position in the bank to establish your eligibility to assume status
of successor in title to the deceased.

You must appreciate that we are constrained from providing you with more
detailed information at this point.

Please respond to this mail as soon as possible to afford us the
opportunity to explain further details to you.

Best Regards,
Patrick Berger.
