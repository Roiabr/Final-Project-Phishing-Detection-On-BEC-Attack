Hello,
 
It gives me a great deal of pleasure to write you this
mail and even when it might come to you as a surprise,
I hope you find it of interest.
 
Let me first introduce myself.  My name is
David Timms. I am an Executive Auditor with a
Bank here in Europe , I would like to  use this means
to ask your assistance  in moving some fund over to
your country. I have in the course of my duties come
in 
contact with a good amount of Fund that have been
inactive for some years now and careful investigation
proved the original depositor of the fund  died five
years ago and all attempt to reach the suppose
beneficiary of the deposit were fruitless and before
it is forfeited to the state I decided to move it.
 
It is of interest to inform you  also that I have
already moved this fund out of the Establishment  and
now in safe keeping with a Finance and security house,
I will  like to
move it outside now and this is were I need your
assistance.
 
After legal consultation, I have established 
modalities for a secured way for  a perfect
transaction., but be most assured that  for your 
assistance and partnership  you will get a
good percentage of the fund, it is  important  to let
you know that fifty percent of  the rest will be
invested over there under your management for a
negotiable  period of time and we will open a fruitful
dialog very soon to that effect.
 
I look forward to our working closely in practically
seeing this transaction come to a perfect end.  For
effective communication, please kindly include in your
reply, your
complete Names, Address, Occupation, Age  and most
especially your phone number and I will contact you
as soon as I get your reply.
 
I  look forward to hearing from you and my gratitude
for your Patience
 
Respectfully yours
David  Timms
