CONFIDENTIAL PROPOSAL [CODE NO: AM-0007]


Good Day,

I am Mr. Ming Yang, Director of Operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd, Sai
Wan Ho Branch, Hong Kong. My purpose of contacting you is because you don=
t
leave in Hong Kong.

I have an obscured business suggestion for you.I am here-by seeking your
service in helping me recieve a large amount of money and in giving a
clear research and feasibility studies on areas I could invest on. Your
services will be paid for, and you will be a partner, if your
recommendation is accepted.


As a bank employee, I can not operate any personal investment till I am
retired and with the Anti-corruption Bill passed in Hong Kong; it is risk=
y
for a fixed income earner to own any huge amount of money in Hong Kong or
any foreign country. It is then advisable to invest in any foreign land
secretly and patiently wait retirement.

For security purpose, due to telecom interception in Hong Kong, I shall
not accept or acknowledge any phone call. Only fax messages/emails would
be treated in relation to this proposal but not without this code; [CODE
NO: AM-0007]. Should you be further interested, I would prefer you to
reach me soon and finally after that I shall provide you with more detail=
s
of this operation.


Kind Regards

Mr. Ming Yang
Hang Seng Bank Ltd
Sai Wan Ho Branch
171 Shaukiwan Road
Hong Kong.
