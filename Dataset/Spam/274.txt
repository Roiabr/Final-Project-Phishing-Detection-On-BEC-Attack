Greetings, 
 
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because I believe everyone will die someday.  My
name is Mr.CAMPBELL WILLIAM, from NEW ZEALAND, I have
been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which was
discovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying for
my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and
right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts. 
 
I have since lost my power of speech and can only
manage to write now, as that has been the only way I
am able to communicate. I have not particularly lived
my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone
not even myself but my business. Though I am very
rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to
people and only focus on my business as that is the
only thing I cared for 
 
But now I regret all this as I now know that there is
more to life than just wanting to have or make all the
money in the world. I believe when God gives me a
second chance to come to this world I would live my
life a different way from how I have lived it. Now
that I know my time is near, I have willed and given
most of my properties and assets to my immediate and
extended family members and as well as a few close
friends. 
 
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and
so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I did on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in UK, Brazil and
Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly,
I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked
members of my family to close one of my accounts and
donate the money, which I have there to charity
organization in Bulgaria and South Africa, they
refused and kept the money to themselves. 
 
Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not
to be contented with what I have left for them. The
last of my money which only few of them knows of is
the huge cash deposit that I have with my Bank in
ABIDJAN. I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.
waiting for reply.
 
Regards, 
MR Campbell William
