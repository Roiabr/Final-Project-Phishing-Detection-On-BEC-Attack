FROM MRS ANNAH KURGA
NO 345 Oxford Road Roosebank
Johannesburg,
TEL: +27-83 9510312.
My Alternative Email Address:  annah1@myway.com
THE DIRECTOR/C.E.O,

My name is Mrs. annah kurga the wife of Wilfred kurga from Zimbabwe. This
might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address, I got
your address from the South African Network Online {SAINO} when I was
desperately looking for a trust-worthy person to assist my son who is
currently residing in South Africa, and so I decided to contact you.
During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supporters
of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his
party members and his followers, he ordered all the white farmers to
surrender their farms to his party members.
My husband was one of the best farmers in our country and because he did
not support Mugabe’s ideas, Mugabe’s supports invaded my husband farm and
burnt everything in the farm, killing my husband and made away with a lot
of items in my husband farm.
Before his death, my husband had deposited with one of the Security
Company in Johannesburg, South Africa the sum of (20Million  United States
Dollars). After the death of my husband, my son {john} decided to move out
of my country to Republic of South Africa where my husband had deposited
the money with the Security Company as valuables.
Please why I am contacting you is to assist my son to move this money out
of South Africa because as asylum seekers he is not allowed to operate any
Bank Account or assured of security our investment within in the country.
We have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 5%
will be out for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this
transaction while 75% will be for me and my family which I believe that
with your help we will invest it in your country.
All I want you to do is to furnish me with your private phone and fax
numbers for easy communication. You can contact my son on his private
telephone number {JOHN KURGA} on: +27-83 9510312. or on his email address
thus: annah1@myway.com
 Waiting for your urgent response.
PLEASE YOU CAN READ ABOUT PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE AND HOW MY HUSBAND DIED,
