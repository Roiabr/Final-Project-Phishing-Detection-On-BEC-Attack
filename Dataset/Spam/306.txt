Re: Your Kind Attention Needed

Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. Chris Swales and I work with a Bank here in =20
London-England, The name of the bank is Barclays Bank. We had a =20
Mr.Allen Duke, customer that had a deposit of US$4.8M (Four Million =20
Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) before he died in a =20
plane crash with his wife and only Child about 6years now (January 30, =20
2000) and since he died, we in the Bank here have been expecting =20
his/her next of kin/relative(s) for the inheritance of the deposit, =20
but none has surfaced.

The policy of the Bank however stipulates a limited time period for =20
such inheritance to be made or the fund will be written off going by =20
the record of the incident, the time limit for the claim is closing =20
up. In this consideration, I am contacting you to seek for your kind =20
understanding and sincere co-operation to claim this inheritance for =20
our mutual benefit.

If you can stand as the next of kin in this project, success is =20
assured because I am in possession of the personal file jacket of the =20
deceased which contains every needed information about the account and =20
the deceased. You and I stand no risk of any kind because I have =20
enough information to support you in claiming the inheritance.

The proceedings of the transaction will be shared 50% each after =20
expenses are reimbursed. Kindly indicate your willingness by email on =20
chriswales@katamail.com and we shall proceed with the initial step for =20
the claim. The entire project is expected to last for about ten =20
working days.

Please kindly get back to me urgently so that we will discuss more on =20
this issue. Also do not fail to furnish me with your direct phone and =20
fax numbers for easier communication.

Best Regards,
Chris Swales
