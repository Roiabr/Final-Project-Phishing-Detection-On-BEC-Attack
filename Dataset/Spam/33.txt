Dear  friend,

This letter must surprise you because we have never meet before neither in
person nor by correspondence, but I believe that it takes just one day to me=
et
or know someone either physically or through correspondence.
I got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as =20
being quite
astute in private entrepreneurship, and one has no doubt in your ability to
handle a financial business transaction. I am Mr. Liu Yan a transfer =20
supervisor
operations in investment section in Bank of China Ltd. Secretariat of =20
the BOCHK
Charitable Foundation 13/F. Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road, Hong =20
Kong I have
an obscured business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war =20
our client
General Mohammed Jassim Ali who work with the Iraqi forces and also =20
business man
made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Ninete=
en
million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only in my branch.

Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even early in the war. Again
after the war another notification was sent and still no response came =20
from him.
We later find out that General Mohammed Jassim Ali and his family had been
killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.After further
investigation it was also discovered that General Mohammed Jassim Ali did no=
t
declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of h=
is
bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my =20
office that
no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Nineteen million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars is still lying in my bank and =20
no one will
ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that, according =20
to the to
the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to th=
e
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali =20
so that you
will be able to receive his funds.I want you to know that I have had =20
everything
planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorn=
ey
that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next o=
f
kin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali, all what is required from you at =20
this stage
is for you to provide me with your Full Names, private phone number =20
and Address
so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made =20
the next of
kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the
necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the transfer of t=
he
funds to an account that will be provided by you with my guidiance.There is =
no
risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized =20
method and
the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this
issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account w=
e
shall discuss the percentage issue on your reply.If you are interested pleas=
e
send me your full names, private phone/fax and current residential address.

Kind Regards

Liu Yan.
