Hello Friend,
 
 
I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting the fund transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Paraguay. Presently I'm in Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.
 
Now contact my secretary, his name is Mr. Ken Brown his telephone number is +27 7300-33288, E-mail is: kenneth.brown@consultant.com ask him to send you the cheque of $800.000.00 which I have made available for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. So feel free and get in touched with my secretary and instruct him where to send the amount to you.
Re-confirm below information's to him:
 
[1]Your full names
[2]Your Contact address
[3]Your telephone/fax numbers 
 
Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy after all the sufferness at that time. At the moment, I am very busy here because of the investment projects which I and the new partner are having at hand, finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with him and he will send the amount to you without any delay.

Best Regard,

Mrs. Doris Janjani.
