Goodday,

Thanks for your response to my email. How are you today and business in
your country? I am Mr. Chen Jiang, Bank Manager of a Bank in China.

I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer that bears the same
surname as you and an investment he placed under our banks management
years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this
mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by
as a result of this mail.

I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed
of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts
that I believe would be of interest to you. Please reply back.
Chen Jiang.
