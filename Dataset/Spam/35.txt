Dearest One,
 
 l am Charles Anthony,23 yrs old,l saw your profile and that was why l decided to write to you.l was in the High School in Ghana studying Mass Communication.My father Late Mr. Mike Anthony  was a Cocoa Merchant here in Cote d'lvoire before his sudden death.
l have been a pet to my parents and they took good care of me as the only child of the family,things were moving fine for us until the sudden death of my Father on 20th March 2004 in a private hospital.But two days to his death,he called me privately in the hospital and gave me some documents,he told me that he deposited $10 million USD in a Bank in Rep of Benin.He was saying as if he will die,l was very shocked,and he continued that l should find a honest person from another country to assist me recieve this money to his account in the person's country for me to invest and continue life,finally he said that this the only treasure he kept because the hospital bill took everything.
The doctor finally told us that he died out of Food Poisoning,this news caused a heart attack to my Mother and she died on 7th December 2005.l have no other place to go because my Uncle pursed me away and was after my life,he even took over my father'property in Duala City with out knowing anything about this fund.
So l decided to seek assylum at the refugee camp in Abidjan when there was a heavy crisis here,l am still now in the refugee camp looking for a honest person that will assist me in recieve this money into his bank account in his country and,then send some money out of the bulk fund for me to come over and continue my Education.l will not hesistate to send to you the documents of the funds as soon as l recieve your e mail.
l have told no body about this until l saw your profile and something in me touches me to tell you hoping that you assist me and take care of me.And l believe that you will assit me.l will give you 25% of the total money for your kind assistance,because l want this money to leave there due to some political crisis going on now and my Uncle's pursuit to kill me and inherit the money.
l want you to send to me your full details .Please contact me with my private email ( ch_20007@yahoo.fr )
l will be wiating to hear from you soonest.
Thanks.
Charles Anthony
