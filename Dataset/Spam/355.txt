FROM.Mr.Ishmila Sani,
Personal Assistant to,
President Charles Taylor(ex)
Date;28th march,2007.

Dear sir/madam,

I personally decided to put in writing as below, the full details of
this business proposal that I have been trying to explain to you. I have
a re-profiling amount in an excess of US$50M,(Fifty Million USD) which I
seek your
partnership in accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this
total sum to you for your quick assistance and partnership, 70% for me and
while 5% should be set side for reimbursement of any unforeseen
expenses we both might incure in the cause of this transaction. However, I
sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I am proposing
to you.

My name is Ishmila Sani, I am the personal assistance to the former President
of Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). President Charles
Taylor decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a
neighboring country Nigeria to seek asylum. Based on these developments, his
various foreign bank accounts have been frozen and some are still under
serious investigation. But in the light of all these happenings,
President Charles Taylor was able, through the help of some loyalist
succeeded
to secretly move the sum of US$50M, on my name as the owner to a
private security company vault where the final crediting is expected to be
carried out later, but recently he has just been arrested and taken
away. You can read more on CNN news of March 30, 2006.

All the depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they
are still in my possession, What I need from you is to stand as the
beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the
documentation which will enable the Security Company transfer / wire the
fund to
your bank account. I have decided to do this only with you and use this
sum to relocate to European, American or Asia continent and never to be
connected to any of President Charles Taylor's conglomerates. This
transaction can be concluded within 2 weeks.
My questions are:-
1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?
3. can you keep this business as very confidential?
4. If you can sponsor this transfer, Is 25% acceptable to you, as your
commission?

Consider this and reach me on my private email above, for more discussion,
so I can
give you more clear explanations details and information about this
transaction. I will also need your direct telephone and fax number for
easy communication. Finally, it is my humble prayer that the information as
contained herein is accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the
secrecy it deserves. Please I need you to send me your telephone number
so I can give you a call immediately for more discussion. As soon as I
get your positive response, I will send you more information to you.

Kinder regards,
Ishmila Sani.ibn.
