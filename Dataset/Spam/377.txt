It is with Heavy Heart I am reaching you regarding the death of my late c=
lient. I am Barrister Stanley Jones, the legal adviser to late MR. MIKE &=
 CAROL HALL, a very Wealthy Couple that lived here in the United Kingdom,=
 before their Death on the 26th of December 2004 during the Tsunami disas=
ter. These couple served God as very dedicated Christians, they so dedica=
ted their life to God but they had no child till they died. They acquired=
 a lot of landed properties like lands, Stocks/Bond, house properties, et=
c. As their legal adviser, before their death, the husband Mr. Mike & Car=
ol Hall instructed me to write his WILL because they had no child; they d=
edicated their wealth to God.=0D
=0D
According to the WILL, their assets should be given out to a ministry for=
 the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the documents for the asset=
s that are deposited with the security company are in my care. He gave me=
 the authority to give out the funds to Ministries for the work of God. A=
s instructed by MR. MIKE HALL before his death. As a matter of fact the t=
otal amount of money that is contained in the two trunk Boxes is $10,000,=
000.00, they did not want the management of the Security Company to know =
the content of the consignments, therefore they registered the content of=
 the consignments=0D
as Gold Bars. Now, the security company believes that what they deposited=
 with them were Gold Bars.=0D
=0D
As a born again Christian, I have been reading my bible and I have to do =
what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to th=
e chosen ministry for the purpose of God\'s work as instructed by the own=
er before his death. After my fasting and prayers Today, I asked God to m=
ake his choice and direct me to an honest Christian or the chosen ministr=
y that deserves this fund by his Grace. I then came across your address o=
n the Internet as I was browsing through a Christian site. I appeal to yo=
u for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of=
 God. I have just notified the Security Company where they deposited the =
consignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the consignment ab=
road, and the security company is awaiting my authority to move the consi=
gnment out of the shores of my country.=0D
=0D
Dear child of Zion, if you know that you will use this fund honestly and =
wisely for things that will glorify God's name, then do contact me with y=
our direct contact address, telephone and fax numbers via my email  addre=
ss=0D
=0D
Your prompt response will be highly appreciated.=0D

Yours in Christ,=0D
