I am Robert Zulugan , a staff of a bank in South Africa. I will give you the
name of my bank and other important information if I receive a positive reply 
from you. For security reasons I cannot disclose my full identity to you now 
until I am sure of your cooperation. 


I work in the operations dept where I serve as account officer to numerous
customers. One of the customers whom I worked as his account officer was a 
wealthy diamond merchant from Australia. Because this man was good to me when he 
was alive, I took it upon myself to travel to his country last month, to see if 
I could locate any of his close relations. On reaching there I discovered that 
his only surviving uncle died a few months back. I sponsored this trip on my own 
and nobody in the bank knew I was undertaking the journey so I did not present 
any official report of my findings in the bank. Now there are two things I could 
do with regards to the money. 


First, as his accounts officer, I could formally notify the bank authorities 
that the man is dead and has no next of kin. In this case the money would be 
forfeited to the government after some time. As a matter of fact this is the 
proper thing I am supposed to do. 


Another thing I can do is to arrange for someone else, a foreigner, to act as 
the next of kin of the late man so that he will claim the money. This is the 
option that I can do to help anybody and myself since the money actually is 
public fund due to the fact that my friend was a close ally to the late brutal 
military president that looted government treasury. And that is why I have 
chosen to do it. I want you to be my partner. All you would have to do is act as 
the next of kin of the dead man and the whole money in the account will be 
transferred to your account. As the accounts officer to the late man, I have all 
the necessary documents that will require claiming the money in the account.The
total money in the account is USD25 million. Your share will be 30%, My own
share will be 70%. 


Reach me immediately by email  so that I can give you further details. Also 
provide me you with direct tel.number to reach you.

Yours truly, 
Robert Zulugan.
