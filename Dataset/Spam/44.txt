Department of Mineral Resources FALKLAND ISLAND SOUTH ATLANTIC. I will be
grateful to have you as my foreign partner to enable us carry out a deal of
Eight million two hundred thousand Great Britain Pounds (=A38,200,000.00).

is
deal without any problem on your side and mine. Also the transfer of the fun=
ds

o
worry about as all documentation will be made legal. All I need from you is
your total support, trust, honesty and confidentiality.

Once the transfer of the funds is successfully made to your account abroad
after your government has taken their taxes from the total amount, 40% of th=
e
remaining amount will be for you while 60% will be for me.

I will give you more breakdown as soon as soon as I hear from you. =20
