Dear Friend,
Please accept my sincere apologizes if my email does not meet your business=
 or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Mr. Peter Leon an aud=
itor with a bank in UK. One of our accounts, with holding balance of =A310.=
000 000,000 (Ten Million pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last operate=
d for years ago. From my investigations, the owner of the said account,Is a=
 foreigner by name MR.JOHN SHUMEJDA who died along with his entire family i=
n crash at Birmingham Airport on 4th Jan, 2002. View this website for verif=
ication http://www.cwn.org.uk/business/a-z/a/agco/2002/01/020104-air-crash.=
htm
Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money,=
 as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the existence of e=
ither the account or the funds; I have confidently discussed this issue wit=
h some of the bank officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign =
partner to deal with.
My proposition to you, is to seek your consent to present you as the Next o=
f kin and beneficiary of this late client, So that the proceeds of this acc=
ount valued a huge sum shall be paid to you, and then we can share the amou=
nt on a mutually agreed percentage of 30% for you,While 60% for me and othe=
rs involved, 10% shall be used for miscelenious expenses while the remainde=
r shall be given to a reputable charity home because the money is owned by =
a deceased person.
This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legiti=
mate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any othe=
r illegal act, funds will be released to you after necessary processes have=
 been followed. Let me hear from you as soon as you get this message, so we=
 can proceed. You can respond using email address mrleonprivate@babbalu.com
Best regards,Mr. Peter Leon.
