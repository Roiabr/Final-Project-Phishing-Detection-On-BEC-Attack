Tel: +27-73-442-5543=20

Pretoria (FCT),=20

South Africa.=20


                    =20
                   =20
                      PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL=20

 Warm Greetings,=20

 I know you will be surprise to receive this letter from a total stranger, =
but do consider it a request from a reputable Attorney-At-Law in a serious =
need of your assistance. I had to bring before you this proposal because I =
sincerely hope you will be reliable to assist me.=20


=20
However, my name is above stated and I am the personal Attorney to Mr. Faro=
oq Ahmed, a national (Citizen) of Malaysia who was working with Shell Petro=
leum Development Company here in South Africa. Here in after shall be refer=
red to as my Client.=20

 Meanwhile, on the 21-08-2005, my client and his family were involved in a =
car accident along Pretoria Expressway while on their way to picnic, and al=
l the occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I=
 have made several enquiries to his Embassy here to locate any of my client=
s Extended Relatives, but all my effort to locate his relatives was abortiv=
e and unsuccessful. So after these unsuccessful attempts, I finally got you=
r contact while I was on a random search.=20

 I have contacted you to assist me in repatriating huge amount of money tha=
t belongs to my death Client; the amount involved is US$14.7Million (Fourte=
en Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars). I sincerely need your urgent as=
sistance before it will be confisicated or declared unserviceable by the So=
uth African Reserve Bank, where this huge amount was deposited. The said ba=
nk has issued me a notice to provide the next of Kin to the deceased or hav=
e the fund confisicated  by the end of this year. For the fact that I have =
been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a year now, I seek you=
r consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the Deceased since you come =
from the same country with my client, so that the proceeds of this account =
can be paid to you.=20

 Therefore, on my receipt to your positive response, we shall discuss on th=
e modus operandi of the transaction/transfer. Note that I have all the nece=
ssary information and legal strength required to back up for this claim. Al=
l I need from you is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transac=
tion through. I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arran=
gement that will protect us from any breach of the law.=20

 Conclusively, your contacts are very essential to facilitate communication=
, so endeavour to enclose your Telephone, Mobile and fax numbers. Further d=
iscussion/elaboration will commence as soon as I hear or read from you, but=
 do not forget the absolute confidentiality and mutual trust required in th=
is transaction. Kindly contact me on the above-specified channels of contac=
t.=20


Thanks and God Bless You.=20

 Yours Truly,=20

 Barrister, Fredrick Thambo
