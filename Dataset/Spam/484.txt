Dear Friend,
  
Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Jonathan Mutambara, In 
charge of Credit and Foreign bills of my Bank, AMALGAMATED BANK OF 
SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA).   I  have an obscured business suggestion for you. 
One of our accounts with a holding balance of Money Valued 
$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars) has been dormant and has not 
been operated for the past six years.  
   
>From my investigations and 
confirmations, the owner  of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a 
citizen of Germany who perished in a plane crash [Concorde Air Flight 
AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard on 31 July2000. And for your 
perusal you can view this web site:http://news.bbc.co.
uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm and since then nobody has done anything 
as  regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members 
who are aware of the existence of the account nor the funds.

Also 
Information from the National Immigration stated  that he was also 
single on entry into South Africa.
  
I have secretly discussed this 
matter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to find a reliable 
foreign partner to deal with. In fact we could have done this deal 
alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants,we 
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually 
raise an eye brows on our side during the time of transfer since we 
still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why we required a 
second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of 
kin with informations which will be made available to you.
 
This 
transaction is totally risk and trouble free as  the fund is legitimate 
and does not originate from  drugs, money laundering, terrorism or any 
other illegal act. 
   
The sharing of the fund between us, is as 
follows; 40% of the total sum will go to you for your effort and 
commitment to the success of this transaction. 60% for me and my 
colleague's. 
 
Forward your reply to jomutambara@fsmail.net 
  
Best 
Regards, 
Mr.Jonathan Mutambara
