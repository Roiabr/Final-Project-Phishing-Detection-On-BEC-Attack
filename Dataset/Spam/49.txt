      From :Joy  SOU,
  15 rue Paris Villa Cocody,
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire. 
   
  Dear Respectful one,
   
  I am totally convinced to write you in reference of the transfer of( 4.5 U S$ )to your account for onward investment (industries) in your country. Though we have not met before but I strongly believe that one has to confiding in someone to succeed sometimes in life. 
  
There is this amount of Four Million, five hundred thousand U.S dollars ($4.500, 000.00) which my late Father (Late Mr.T.William SOU ) deposited for me in a   and storage firm here in Abidjan before he was assassinated by some unknown hoodlums in on going political war here . 
 
Because of recent political/civil war eructed here, I decided to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside Africa for security and political reasons. 
I want you to help me to transfer this fund to your country for investment.
   
   If you can be of assistance to me, I will be pleased to offer to you the 20% Of this total fund (indicated above). 
 
Further details will be made known to you on confirmation of your interest to assist me . 
  
Your urgent reply will be highly appreciated. 
 
Thanking you and God bless.
 
Joy,
