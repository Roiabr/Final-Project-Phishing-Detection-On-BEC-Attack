body has done anything as regards the claiming of this money, as he has no =

unt or the funds; I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the =
bank officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to ass=
it me.  My proposition to you, is to seek your consent to present you as th=
e Next of kin and beneficiary of this late client, So that the proceeds of =
this account valued a huge sum shall be paid to you, and then we can share =
the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 30% for you,While 60% for me =
and others involved, 10% shall be used for miscelenious expenses while the =
 remainder shall be given to a reputable charity home because the money is =
owned  by a deceased person.  I will be released to you after necessary pro=
cesses have been  followed. Let me hear from you as soon as you get this me=
ssage, so we can proceed.  Best regards,Mboma
