     My Dear Respectful , My name is Frank kone a Banker and accountant in =
Cote Ivoire.I am contacting you in regards to a business transfer of a larg=
e sum of money from a dormant account. Though I know that a transaction of =
this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assurin=
g you that all will be well at the end of the day.
I am the personal accounts manager to the late Engr lake a National of your=
 country, who used to work with an oil servicing company here in Cote Ivoir=
e.My client, his wife, and their three children were involved in the ill fa=
ted Kenya Airways crash in the coasts of Abidjan in January 2000 in which a=
ll passengers on board died. Since then I have made several inquiries to yo=
ur embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but has been unsu=
ccessful.
After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over =
the internet,to see if I could locate any member of his family hence I cont=
acted you.Of particular interest is this huge deposit with our bank here in=
 my country Cote Diviore,where the deceased has an account valued at about =
($16 million US dollars).They have issued me a notice to provide the next o=
f kin or our  bank will declare the account unservisable and thereby send t=
he funds to the bank treasury. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating t=
he relatives for over last 7 years now, I will seek your consent to present=
 you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last names,=
 so that the proceeds of this account valued at ($16million US dollars) can=
 be paid to you and then you and I can share the money.
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through=
.I guarantee that this will be executed under all legitimate arrangement th=
at will protect you from any breach of the law.=20
In your reply mail, I want you to give me your full names, address, date of=
 birth, telephone and fax numbers.If you can handle this with me, reach me =
 for more details.=20
Thanking you for your anticipated cooperation.  Sincerely,
Frank kone.
