rship as chairman but will be bringing in profit /distribute profit month=
ly or annually as we may agreed.

I have US$30 million dollars deposited with a bank in London for safety w=
hich I want to invest into real estate or hotel management with any compa=
ny who can help and manage on behalf of my family, while I will be in par=
tnership with you. If you are interested you can go ahead to look for a s=
uitable place in any city in your country or any country of your
choice where the business is viable.

Please, note that as we progress you may be communicating with my only le=
