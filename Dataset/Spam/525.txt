AB 01 COCODYTreshville Abidjan My Name is Miriam; I worked as a maid to Mr.=
 ROBERT BUTLER an American, who used to be a contractor with an oil servici=
ng company based here in Cote D=92Ivoire. Last year,{Jan. 2006} my master d=
ied of a serious illness, but before his death, he told me in confidence of=
 a fund of Twenty Seven Million dollars (US$27,000,000.00) which he conceal=
ed in two trunk boxes and  deposited with a finance House in Cote D=92Ivoir=
e. However, the Finance house does not know the true content of the trunk t=
o be cash as my Master declared upon deposit as containing art craft for ex=
port. Because of the fast deteriorating state of his health, he was afraid =
that he might die loosing all he has in a foreign country. He instructed me=
 that if he dies, I should try everything within my capability to make sure=
 that his fund at the safe keeping house gets into the hands of the less pr=
ivileged in his home country and he handed over the documents of this depos=
it to me with a written instruction.  I have contacted the finance house ov=
er this issue, but they refused to release the trunk Boxes to me, unless I =
bring any of Mr. ROBERT BUTLER'S relatives. This is a very tough situation =
for me, because since I lived with my master, he has not mentioned any of h=
is family or extended relatives and Since I have been unsuccessful in locat=
ing the relatives for over a year now, I seek your consent to present you t=
o the finance house as an extended relative of my master so that the trunk =
boxes can be released to you and you will use some part of the money inside=
 for the good purpose of my master while the both of us share the remaining=
..
If you can handle this with me, kindly respond back immediately and we will=
 negotiate on what will be given to you for your kind effort.
Thanking you for your cooperation.
Miriam
