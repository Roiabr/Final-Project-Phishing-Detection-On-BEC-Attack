years. On this note, I have acquired a total sum of
=A335million (Thirty-Five Million Great Britain Pounds
Sterling) representing the 1.3% of ROI and hereinafter
need someone that will be ready to work with me to
receive the aforementioned funds on my behalf without
my establishment knowing that I am the bona fide owner
of the funds.However, there is no risk involved as
well as legal implication. Our sharing ratio will be

Mr. Robert King.
