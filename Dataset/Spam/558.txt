FROM THE DESK OF MASSAN AHMED
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.
Dear Sir,
              I am the manager of bill and exchange foreign remittance at 
the department of Bank Of Africa (BOA).
In my departmentn we discovered an abandone sum of $ 22.6 m US dollars 
(Twenty two  Millon six hundred thousand  US dollars) . In an account that 
belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family 
in a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the 
whole life of the pasengeres on board.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash 
leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depar
tment now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and 
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don;t want this 
money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.
The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin 
in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner 
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my 
colleagues.

Thereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement 
accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate 
trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank 
as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your 
bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and 
effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.

   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text 
of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. 
Trusting to hear from you immediately.
  Your;s faithfully,
  MR.MASSAN AHMED
(Bill and exchange manager)
  BANK OF AFRICA (BOA).
