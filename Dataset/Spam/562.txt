Compliments.

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a
hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. We want to transfer to an
oversea account ($16,700.000.00 USD) Sixteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) from one of the banks located in Dakar Senegal. I
want to ask you, If you are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and
honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank
account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even
an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain
honest to me till the end of this important business ,I am trusting in you
and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in
future.

I am Mr Philip Tarila. a personal assiatant to late Andreas Schranner.
During the course of his bank's last week auditing,it was discovered that
since his death no one has come forward to lay claim to this funds.So the
bank issued me a memo to provide his next of kin or forfeith the funds. This
account was opened with the bank in 1999 and since 2000 nobody has operated
on this account again, after going through some old files in my records,I
discovered that my late client  died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money
is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be
forfeited for nothing.
The owner of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a German property magnate
who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of AF4590 German Concorde
which crahsed on July 25th 2000,including his family leaving nobody as next
of kin.
No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that the account is a secret account.

The total amount involved is Sixteen million Seven Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars only [$16, 700.000.00] and we wish to transfer this money
into a safe foreigners account abroad. But I don't know any foreigner, I am
only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, but to a foreigner who has information about the
account, which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I am
revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting
for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take urgently.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total
amount,70% will be for us, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might
have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your
earliest reply. PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.reply to (
philip_tarila01@myway.com)

Best Regards,

Mr.Philip Tarila.
