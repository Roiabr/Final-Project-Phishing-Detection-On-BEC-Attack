Dear friend,

I am making this contact with you based on trust and confidence I have for
you, your Company and God irrespective of the fact that we have not
met before and because of the nature of the business I am about to introduce
to you,I want to remain positive having the faith, the will
and convincing myself that you will be interested and capable to do business
with me.This business proposal I wish to intimate you with is
of mutual benefit and its success is entirely based on mutual
trust,cooperation and a high levelof confidentiality as regard this
transaction.My name is Mr. Daniel Johnson The kind of the relationship and
the confidential nature makes it imperative for me to contact you
directly by email. A German, Late Estate Magnate Mr.Andreas Schranner, a
majority stakeholder in Korean Real Estate Company ,until his death
years ago in 25th July,2000 CONCORDE plane clash [Flight AF4590]
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/worl d/europe/859479.stm>),There is a fixed
deposit of US$48,000,000.00(Fourty Eight Million United States Dollars) made
in a Korea bank since 1998 which is eight years now and since
thenno claim or withdrawal have been made on that deposit.

Fortunately, I have been the person in charge of this deposit from the day
of deposit to date. This great late Estate Magnate died without a
written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account with respect to his
investment in Korea Real Estate Company. It is because of the perceived
possibility of not being able to locate any of his next of kin. Rapidly,I
took the precaution of converting this funds worth
US$48,000,000.00Dollarsto the[open secure progamme] and deposited it with
OPEN BENEFICARY-which allowsanybody or person that has accurate
informationto the deposit can lay claim to it.

As a proposed partner i must confided in you immensely,therefore to use my
position to move this money outside Korea through dedicated bank in
Europe to your designated account with consolidated arrangement. It can be
transferred to your custody if you are willing and assure me of your
ability to handle such a sum and honesty that I will not be cheated out when
the money comes into your account.I am willing to let you keep 20%
of this fund for your assistance.

Indicate your willingness by return email.

Sincerely yours,
Mr Daniel Johnson.
