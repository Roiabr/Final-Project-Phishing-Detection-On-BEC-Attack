Dear Friend,

Good day. I decided to contact you after I went through my father’s file. 
Hence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.

My name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds, a wealthy 
farmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my 
country, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Our wicked President Robert  
mugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have 
become his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and 
a moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of 
brutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.

Here is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he  
deposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars (US$10,000,000.00) with a 
security company,The money was deposited as a gem/precious stone in a metal 
trunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company 
organization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and 
chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and 
Swaziland.

The government seized my father’s farms and bank account before his Murder. 
He told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This 
is why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, 
so that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment 
of the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your 
assistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the 
government does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge 
sum of money. In view of this, The monetary policy/law does not allow such 
investment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if you can 
assist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed.


As I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this
information as top secret. Then u can also contact me through this 
alternative mail (mr_desmond3@yahoo.com.au)

Yours Sincerely,
Mr.Desmond Martin.
