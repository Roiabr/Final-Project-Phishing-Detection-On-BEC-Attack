unt number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who di=
ed along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airline=
s Flight number 261 which crashed on January 31, 2000. You shall read more =
about the crash on visiting this site: http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/ala=
ska.airlines.list/ The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an Amer=
ican and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon=

d for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruct=
ion which I will be send to you as the next of kin or relation to the decea=
sed for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it an=
d I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  =
