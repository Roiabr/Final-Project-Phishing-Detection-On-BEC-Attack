Hello,
=20
I write to solicit your assistance in a funds transfer deal involving US$=
 3.5M.This fund has been stashed out of the excess profit made last year =
by this branch of the International Commercial Bank which I am the manage=
r. I have already submitted an approved end of the year report for the ye=
ar 2005 to my head office here in Accra-Ghana and they will never know of=
 this excess. I have since then, placed this amount on a Non-Investment A=
ccount without a beneficiary.

Upon your response, I will configure your name on our database as holder =
of the Non-Investment Account. I will then guide you on how to apply to m=
y head office for the Account Closure/ bank-to-bank remittance of the fun=
ds to your designated bank account.

If you concur with this proposal, I intend for you to retain 30% of the f=
unds while 70% shall be for me.
