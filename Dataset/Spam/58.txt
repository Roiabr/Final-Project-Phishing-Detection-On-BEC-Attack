Dear,
=20
Due to the on going political crisis in this country (Ivory-Coast-Cote d'Iv=
oire), I really want to relocate to your country to continue with my educat=
ion. I was a second year student of Medicine in the university before I los=
t my parent and since then I have stopped schooling. I have enough money to=
 train myself out of school from an inheritance I inherited from my parent.=
 All I need from you is to accept me and to give me an invitation to help m=
e come over to your country.=20
=20
I know that this mail may come to you as a surprise. My name is David Djedj=
ess from Congo Republic. But I am presently living in Asylum camp here in A=
bidjan Cote d'Ivoire-Ivory coast. I am 23 yrs old. Since no prearrangement =
was made before the sudden death of my parents in a motor accident, most of=
 our belonging has been confiscated by my wicked uncles whose love of wealt=
h has driven to lose of common sense.=20
=20
Since after the sudden death of my parents, I=92ve learnt a lesson of the r=
eal responsibilities of life. Here I am making vital decisions for my futur=
e. I had to contact you regardless of the fact that we have not known each =
other personal, to assist me as my guardian. I prayed over this issue first=
 before my mind was made up to contact you. I really need your help and ass=
istance to help me move US$16,500,000.00 (Sixteen million five hundred thou=
sand United states dollars) over to your country for investment and to enab=
le me to continue with my education in your country.=20
=20
I expect to hear from you soon. In you reply, please tell me more about you=
rself, are you married with children? what do you do for a living? Waiting =
for your prompt response.=20
=20
Remain bless.
Yours sincerely
David.
