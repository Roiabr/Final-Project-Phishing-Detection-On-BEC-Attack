MRS. MARIA SOCORRO
CREDIT ACCOUNTS OFFICER
HEAD OFFICE EQUITABLE PCI BANK TWR.
MKT AVENUE. COR.H.V DELA COSTA STR
PHILIPPINES.
Good Day,
Let me start by introducing myself, I am MRS MARIA  SOCORRO, CREDIT 
ACCOUNTS OFFICER EQUITABLE PCI BANK. I am writing you this letter based on 
the latest development at my bank, which I will like to bring to your 
personal edification. I am writing you this letter with so much joy and 
excitement even though my heart goes out to the very powerfuland 
distinguished gentleman who I was fortunate to have worked for and extremely 
privileged to have known for numerous years.
I am a top official in charge of client accounts in EQUITABLE PCI BANK 
inside the Philippines.In 2001, my client was going through a 
horrendous divorce in the United States Of America and Was on the verge of 
losing most of his estate to his vicious and diabolical wife. As a result of 
this alarming predicament, my client came to me with a very brilliant 
idea. He transferred some funds, ten million two hundred thousand 
dollars($10.2m) to a fixed deposit account in my bank under an alias which 
only the two of us knew about as the confidentiality of the matter was 
necessary for his protection.
Due to his untimely death in early 2002, the funds have been sitting in 
the account ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we 
do something about it. This is where you come in. I located you through 
an agency that helps seek people by their email.
My client did not declare any next of kin in his official papers 
including the paperwork of his bank deposit. Against this backdrop, my 
suggestion to you is that I would like you as a foreigner to stand as the 
next of kin to our client so that you will be able to receive his funds. I 
want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we can 
come out successful.
I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document 
that will back you up as the next of kin to my client. All that is 
required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full 
Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.
The allocation of our money will be as follows: 20%($2.02m) to you for  
your part in this, 75% for me and my partners and 5% for any 
unforeseeable expenses we may incur.You can contact with this 
mail;(mrs_socorro27@hotmail.com)
kind Regards,
Mrs. Maria Socorro
