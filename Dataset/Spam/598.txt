My Dear Beloved,

     Let me start by introducing myself. I am  Mr. Maekal Mekha, a Baghda=
d Citizen, Iraq, a Mechant as an occupation. I have a obscured business s=
uggestion for you. I am a brother to Dr.Gerald Mekha,who worked with=20
Iraq Judicial Commission , Iraq, for over a decade before he died on 20th=
 of March in the year 2007.

He died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. Before his deat=
h he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privi=
leged in the society. When my brother was alive he deposited the sum of =A3=
250 Million Pounds (Two Hundred and Fifty Million Pounds) with one United=
 Kingdom Security Company in London.

This funds are still with the Security Company for the past 6 years now,t=
he funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes, deposited with these com=
pany, i am in a refugee camp here in Iraq, as a result of the war in=20
Iraq this moment, am sorry am not too fine based on my health,though what=
 disturbs me most is my stroke.=20

Having known my condition and want to make sure i do my father's will, I =
have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company,that will ut=
ilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.=20

I want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide su=
ccor to poor and indigent persons, orphanages, and widows and for propaga=
ting peace in the universe. I understand that blessed is the hand that gi=
veth. I took this decision because I do not have any one that will inheri=
t this money and my staying in the refugee camp, still don't know when i'=
ll be granted the visa permit out of Iraq. I do not want a situation wher=
e this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taki=
ng this bold decision.

I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my un=
easy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in Iraq. Also becaus=
e of the presence of social security in the camp, I do not want them to k=
now. With Allah all things are possible.

 As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact information=
 of the Security Company in London,United Kingdom. I will also issue you =
a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary o=
f this fund. I want you to always pray for me.

My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that w=
ants to serve the Almighty Allah must serve him with all his heart and mi=
nd and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through you=
r life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an indi=
vidual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordin=
g to my specification herein.=20

Hoping to hear from you. Thank you and may the Almighty Allah bless you.
Kindly send your email message to my mailbox :  mekha_llcs@yahoo.dk  , so=
 i can contact you with more information=20

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Maekal Mekha
