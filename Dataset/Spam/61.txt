Dear Friend,I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have=
 never met before. My name is  Mr Adams   Swll.   I am the bill and exchang=
e manager in African Development Bank. I hope that you will not expose or b=
etray this trust and confidence that I am about to repose on you for the mu=
tual benefit of our both families.I am writing in respect of a foreign cust=
omer of our Bank who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Li=
ne, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on 6th of august 1997 and f=
or your perusal you can view this site http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/gua=
m.passenger.listSince the demise of this our customer, I personally have wa=
tched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive=
 as no one has come to claim his funds of US$11.3M (Eleven Million Three Hu=
ndred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a =
very long time.On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be u=
sed as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again. The Banki=
ng ethics here do not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because =
the money will be recalled to our Banks treasury as unclaimed fund after th=
is period.In view of this I got your contact through the Internet when I wa=
s making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great opportunit=
y because I don't want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as unc=
laimed fund. I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest =
60% will be for me.
The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the decease=
d man was a foreigner and it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank =
for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund.So the request =
for you as a foreigner to come into the business is necessary, it will faci=
litate the release and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Ban=
k account as the only surviving relation to the deceased.If you are really =
sure of your integrity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to =
cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with your telephone and f=
ax numbers and Banking account details where you wish to receive the fund.U=
pon receipt of the above mentioned information, indicating your interest in=
 the business, I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application whi=
ch you will type and send back to our bank to enable us start this transact=
ion.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is risk free=
 and doesn't have any negative implication. You should not entertain any fe=
ar as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund have bee=
n finalized. This transaction will be completed within 14 bank working days=
 immediately we start the business.Waiting for your urgent response and ple=
ase kindly delete if you are not interested.Regards, Mr Adams   Swll
