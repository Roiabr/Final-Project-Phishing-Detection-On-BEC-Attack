Hello,
I have gone through your profile which informed my
contemplation to enquire in confidence,if we can jointly do some
genuine and legal stock transfer trading together based on a Joint Venture.
I have an operative international certified acceptable Medium Term
Note Stock (Program) le, which I was thinking we could work with you
to reassign the account to your name, and I assume you must have
powerful financial sense and capability. After the reassignment, the
amount would be transferred to your bank account.
The principal amount of the POF is US$50 Million, and I have already
worked out modalities to execute the transfer successfully; hence I
ask of you to confirm ASAP whether or not you are interested.
The BOE is an irrevocable Bank Operative Instrument, which you can
use as collateral to bank against a loan immediately we fully reassign to
you, which means your bank can even borrow against it. I shall send
you evidence of funds which once can still through bank-to-bank confirm
existence.
I would appreciate that you get back to me upon receipt of this
important mail on your opinion towards a lasting business
relationship.

Respectfully,
Williams Morrow
