Allen & Overy. (LLP)
Private Consultants.
One New Change London EC4M9QQ. England.

I am Richard Wainwright, a private consultant for very eminent personnels
in the Asian and Middle East region.
These personnels have appointed me to source on their behalf a credible
foreigner with whom they can jointly entrust areasonable amount of money,
which will be chanelled into a highly lucrative business venture. They
have $150million(one hundred and fifty million United States dollars)
transferred.

They request strict confidentiality due to their public nature, they
prefer to be anonymous hence I have been given the mandate to source for
some one of high business experience with very good reputationThis is the
proposal in summary:

1. My client (s) are top politicians/government officials in the Asian an=
d
Middle East region they want the funds to be invested through a
well-established businessman abroad who can front for them without
disclosing their true identity

2. All that is required is your willingness to invest this money for them
in a highly lucrative business venture under strict profitable monitoring

3. A power of attorney will be given to you to manage these funds on thei=
r
behalf

4. You will be awarded as compensation a certain percentage from the
proceeds of the investment, which is still
negotiable.

If you are interested, and you have the capacity to handle the transactio=
