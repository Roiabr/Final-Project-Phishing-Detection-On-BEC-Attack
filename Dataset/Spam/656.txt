 Hello,

 My name is Mrs Maryam Ibrahim,owner of MARYAM 
 IBRAHIM TEXTILES TRADING, TAILORING & EMBROIDERY
 Po Box 34285 Dubai,United Arab Emirates.Am 58years old,
 suffering from long time cancer of the breast.
 From all indications my condition is really
 deteriorating and it's quite obvious that I won't
 live more than 2 months according to my doctors.
 This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a
 very bad stage.
  
 My late husband died early last year from
 heart attack, and during the period of our marriage
 we couldn't produce any child. My late husband was
 very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business 
 and wealth.The doctor has advised me that I
 will not live for more than 2 months, so I have now
 decided to spread all my wealth, to contribute mainly
 to the development of charity in Africa, America, Asia
 and Europe.

 Before my late husband died he was a major oil tycoon,
 in dubai and deposited the sum of 20 million dollars
 (Twenty million dollars) in a security company in europe some
 years ago,thats all i have left now,i need you to collect this funds 
 and distribute it yourself to charity.
 so that when i die my soul can rest in peace.
 the funds will be entirely in hands and management.
 I pray God gives you the wisdom to touch
 very many lives,that is my main concern.
 
 20% of this money will be for your time and effort,
 while 80% goes to charity.

 God bless you.
 Mrs. Maryam Ibrahim.
