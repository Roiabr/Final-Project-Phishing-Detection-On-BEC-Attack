MANAGING DIRECTOR
DAH SING BANK LTD
36TH FLOOR DAH SING BANK
FINANCIAL CENTRE LTD.
108 GLOUCESTER ROAD,
HONG KONG
Phone/Fax: +852-3010-7073


Dear Friend,


I am Mr. Hon-Hing Wong , Managing Director Dah Sing Bank Ltd, Hong Kong.


I am contacting you with respect to a portfolio amounting to $35,520,000
USD (Thirty Five Million, Five Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States
Dollar) deposited by a German Merchant named Mr. Mathew Schneider.


On the 18th of October 2002  Mr. Mathew Schneider  deposited $12,000,000
USD (Twelve Million United States Dollars) under our portfolio management
department for four years and the deposit matured on the 18th of October
2006 with over 196% growth which amounted to a total of $35,520,000 USD
(Thirty Five Million, Five Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States
Dollar).


Mr. Mathew Schneider, has since passed away without stating his next of
kin because he deposited the funds in our establishment at a point he was
finalizing divorcing his wife and had no kids coupled with the fact that
he was an orphan, this funds has since mature and the roll-over on the
funds has also expired.


This sum of $35,520,000 USD (Thirty Five Million, Five Hundred and Twenty
Thousand United States Dollar) is still  in my possession in my Bank
lifeless and unnoticed because there will never be a claim on the funds
and all material and immaterial documents and certificates relating to the
funds is also in my possession.


According to the Hong Kong Law regulating cases of this nature which is
also typical to other Asian countries, at the expiration of 5 (five)
years, such funds will revert to the ownership of the Government for
financing military operations, such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions
for the military.


In order to avert this negative development, I will like to seek for your
permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Mathew
Schneider so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for
financing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the
world in general.


The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of
60% for me and 35% for you and the balance of 5% for  will be responsible
for the major /trivial expenses incurred in the course of the transaction.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this project will be done
by my attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the
successful execution of this project. If you are interested, please reply
immediately.


Upon your response, I shall then provide you with further information's
and modalities that will help you understand the transaction.


You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
project would be most profitable for both parties because I shall require
your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Thanks and regards.

Mr. Hon-Hing Wong
