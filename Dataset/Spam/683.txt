FROM THE DESK OF RAJI RAJI
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  (ADB)
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.

Dear Friend,

How are you,first i will explain my self little to youbefore we continue. I 
am the manager of bill and
exchange at the foreign remittance department ofAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 
(ADB)I am writing to seekyour interest over a transaction.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of$15m US dollars (FIFTEEN 
MILLIONS US DOLLARS) . In anaccount that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer
who died along with his entire family in November 2002  in a plane crash. 
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin   or relation died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one orther official in my 
department have decided to make this business proposal to you and release 
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety 
and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want 
this money to go into the Bank's treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank's 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannotstand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a
foreign account,  10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the 
business and 50 % would be for me and my colleague. There after I will visit 
your country for disbursement of the fund according to the percentages 
indicated in this proposal. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of 
this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations 
or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account 
number, your private
telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location 
where in the money will beremitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of the 
application. I will not fail to
bring to your notice that this transaction  is hitch free and that you 
should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.


Trusting to hear from you immediately.


Your’s faithfully RAJI RAJI
Bill and Exchange Manager,
Africa Development Bank (A.D.B)
