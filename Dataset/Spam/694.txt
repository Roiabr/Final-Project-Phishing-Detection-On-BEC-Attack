people would look for him/her for assistance. Pls .Do not allow this golden 
opportunity to slip off my hands, as I believe it will be of good benefit to

My reason for writing to you is for the fact that I need your assistance to 
make a transfer of US$26.2Million to your bank account and this requires to 
be done through a trusted person, who will not seat on the fund after the 
transfer of the fund.

Sheriff Johnson, the son of Mr. Benjamin Johnson. My father Mr. Benjamin was 
the former economic adviser on petroleum to the Head of state of Equatorial 
Guinea. He was poisoned to death by his business partner
about some months ago, and he died in a private hospital here in Malabo – 
Equatorial Guinea. When he was about to die, he (secretly) called me beside 
his sick bed and told me that he deposited the sum of (USD26.2Million United 
State Dollars) in Ghana Bank call SG-SSB BANK LTD  this he told me as he was 
about to die.

your bank account in securing this fund.

not forget to include your personal telephone number for easy communication.
