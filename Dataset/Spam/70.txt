ow million Pounds Sterling. and on further discreet investigation I also di=
scovered that the account holder has long since passed away (dead)leaving n=
o beneficiary or WILL to the account. He died without a [WILL] hence the mo=
ney is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be fo=
rfeited for nothing.If i left the fund in the bank Government will claim it=
 to treasury and nobody will benefit out of it. I have been his account off=
icer until his death and nobody will ever come or ask about the fund. My ba=
nk does not know the status of the account owner and the account opening in=

llowed accordingly. I am contacting you to place you as the next of kin to =
the deceased and I will provide to you the necessary claim documents the ba=
nk will require from you in other to claim this fund including the details =

remaining rest amount to your account.I will inform you on what to do if yo=
u are going to assure me that you will not betray me and my family with thi=
