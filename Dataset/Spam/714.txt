Hallo friend,

This letter must surprise you because we have never meet before =20

just one day to meet or know someone either physically or through =20
correspondence.
I got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as =20
being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, and one has no doubt =20
in your ability to handle a financial business transaction. I am Mr. =20
Liu Yan a transfer supervisor operations in investment section in Bank =20
of China Ltd. Secretariat of the BOCHK Charitable Foundation 13/F. =20

business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client =20
General Mohammed Jassim Ali who work with the Iraqi forces and also =20
business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, =20
with a value of Nineteen million Five Hundred Thousand United States =20
Dollars only in my branch.

Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even early in the war. =20
Again after the war another notification was sent and still no =20
response came from him. We later find out that General Mohammed Jassim =20
Ali and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that =20
hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that =20
General Mohammed Jassim Ali did not declare any next of kin in his =20
official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he =20
also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one =20
except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Nineteen million Five =20
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars is still lying in my bank and =20
no one will ever come forward to claim it.

What bothers me most is that, according to the to the laws of my =20
country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the =20
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the =20
funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like =20
you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Mohammed =20
Jassim Ali so that you will be able to receive his funds.I want you to =20
know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out =20
successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the =20
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to General =20
Mohammed Jassim Ali, all what is required from you at this stage is =20
for you to provide me with your Full Names, private phone number and =20
Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been =20
made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on =20
your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in =20
your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be =20
provided by you with my guidiance.There is no risk involved at all in =20
the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney =20
will prepare all the necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning =20
this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated =20
bank account we shall discuss the percentage issue on your reply.If =20
you are interested please send me your full names, private phone/fax =20
and current residential address, and I will prefer you to reach me on =20

operation.
