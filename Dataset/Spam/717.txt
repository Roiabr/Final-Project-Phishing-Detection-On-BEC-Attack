On further investigation, I found out that <BR>he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of <BR>kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and <BR>discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his <BR>official documents, including his Bank Depos!
it paperwork <BR>in my Bank. This sum of US$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank <BR>and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end <BR>of each year. <BR><BR>No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws ofRepublic <BR>of China, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to <BR>the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the <BR>fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner <BR>to stand in as the next of kin to the man so that the fruits of this <BR>old man's <BR>labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government <BR>officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your <BR>full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary <BR>documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. <BR><BR>shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and authorization <BR>of the WILL and to obtain the necessary doc!
uments and letter of <BR>probate/administration in your favor!
 for the transfer.A bank account in <BR>any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the <BR>transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money <BR>will be paid into your <BR>account for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 50% for you. <BR><BR>There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will <BR>be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager <BR>guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are <BR>interested, please reply immediately via the private email address <BR>chenjiang022@yahoo.com.hkUpon your response, I shall then provide you <BR>with more details and <BR>relevantdocuments that will help you understand the transaction.
