Dear friend, =0D
=0D
I apollogize in advance if this mail comes as an embarrassment because of=
 so many things that happens in our times. I am Isaac Baka, the site insp=
ection director with the ministry ofworks and construction and I worked d=
irectly with the Minister in charge of the Ministry here in Republic of S=
udan.=0D
   =0D
I awarded a contract to a firm worth several millions of dollars a few ye=
ars ago. In the course of executing the project the firm discovered large=
 gold deposit in one of the construction sites. Being the site director I=
 collaborated with the firm in the mining of the gold on a mutual agreeme=
nt to share the proceeds out of which I got a share of 7.5 Million. =0D
=0D
As a civil servant in this small war torn country, I cannot introduce thi=
s funds into the banking system here considering my meager monthly income=
 as well as the code of conduct guidelines regulating civil service here =
in my country, Sudan. Presently Sudan is engulfed in a civil crisis and a=
s this crisis intensified by the day, I have decided to move this fund ou=
t for any profitable venture. The fund will be moved out of Sudan under d=
iplomatic cover as soon as we conclude all procedure.=0D
=0D
I therefore solicit for your co-operation to take delivery of this fund i=
nto your custody for any profitable investment that will be mutually bene=
ficial. I will be able to arrange all necessary procedures to ensure smoo=
th movement of this funds until you are in control of it.  =0D
=0D
Please let me know if you are interested by return mail to be sent to: (i=
sbaka@myway.com, isbaka@sify.com). Also include your full names and conta=
ct telephone number to enable me call you. I will provide you with more i=
nformation as soon as you indicate appreciable interest to deal. =0D

Regards,=0D
