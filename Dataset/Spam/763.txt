Dear Friend, =0D
=0D
My name is Mrs. Xian and I am a bank manager of a reputable bank in China=
. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail co=
nfidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a =
result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation a=
nd no one is informed of this communication. =0D
=0D
The subject in questions was a client with my bank and until his demise h=
e maintained an investment in millions of dollars, which has since reache=
d its maturity. The subject maintained a discrete relationship with us an=
d never nominated a legatee to his investment. At the time of his demise =
he was yet to sign the mandate card and he remained in testate. It is eth=
ical that his investment with us be confiscated by government and to be r=
everted to treasury but not quite, it would be diverted and embezzled by =
insincere executives. =0D
=0D
Consequently, what I propose is that I will like you as a foreigner to st=
and in as the next of kin to the deceased. Acting in this capacity really=
 is simple, as I will explain in detail to you when I get your response. =
=0D
=0D
However, I wish to appeal to you not to be vindictive if my proposal does=
 not appeal to you, just delete it and forget I ever contacted you with t=
his proposal. Ordinarily I would not do this but all humans have needs an=
d there are circumstances that you would get to understand better should =
we work together on this project. =0D
=0D
Awaiting your urgent reply through my alternative email xmei_2001@163.com=
 for security reasons.=0D
=0D
Yours Sincerely,=0D
