Good Day=2C




My name is Mr=2E Micheal Tan=2E I trained and work as an external auditor for the United 
Oversea Bank =28UOB=29 Malaysia=2E
   
I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because a late 
investor =2C who bears the same last name  with you has left monies totaling a little 
over $10 million United States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and 
no next of kin has come forward all these years=2E
   
 
Banking regulation legislation in malaysia  demand that I notify the fiscal authorities 
after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are 
called in by the monetary regulatory bodies=2E
   
 
The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing=2EI am of the settled conviction 
that using my insider leverage=2C working with you=2Csince you have the same last Name with 
the Late Investor=2C we can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it 
pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Malaysia =2E
   
 
   
This exactly is why I crave your participation and cooperation=2EI have seized all 
relevant information =28legal and Banking=29 that will facilitate our putting you forward 
as the claimant=2Fbeneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any 
account nominated by you=2E
   
 
   
Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there 
will be no risk =2E Needless to say=2C Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if 
we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction=2E 
   
 
I have intentionally left out the finer details for now until I hear from you=2E To affirm 
your willingness and co-operation to my proposal please do so by email=2C stating your full 
names=2C date of birth=2C telephone number and fax number and occupation=2E I do expect your 
prompt response=2E
   
 
   


Thank you
