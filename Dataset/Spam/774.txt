Attn: Sir/Madam,

        {HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL}
(RE: TRANSFER OF 
(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE 
THOUSAND POUNDS 
STERLINGS)
RE: TRANSFER OF 36,759,000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR 
ACCOUNT.

My name is Mr.Bernard Martin and I work in the International 
Operation Department in a Bank here in London. I feel quite safe 
dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium 
(Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it 
because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, 
this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated 
as such. 

At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 
100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT 
MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN 
ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader.
Until his death,The Late Prime Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge 
investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a 
matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND 
FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London 
which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about 
this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant 
domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED 
AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet 
investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed 
away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will 
approve this money to any foreigne r because the former operator of the 
a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for 
the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with 
legal claims to the account Holder, 

Therefore I need your cooperation 
in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in 
order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down 
now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - 
February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-
made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister 
of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from 
office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 
2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated 
as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese 
capital, for more information please log on to(http://www.hariri.info/)

I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I 
DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE 
WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT 
BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING 
THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. Let 
me hear from you urgently through this Email<bernardmartin01@rediffmail.

Best Regards 

Mr.Bernard Martin.
