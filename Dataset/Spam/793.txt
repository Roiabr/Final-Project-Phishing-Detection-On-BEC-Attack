You may be surprise to receive this latter since you do not know me =
personally .I got your contact through Johannesburg chamber of commerce .I am =
Mr. Johnson Moyo the son of late Dr. Raymond Moyo who was recently murdered =
in the land dispute in Zimbabwe .my late father was among the few black =
Zimbabwean rich farmer who was murdered in cold blood by the agent of the =
ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for allegedly supporting the =
party controlled by the white minority.
 
Before the death of my father he had taken to Johannesburg, republic of South =
Africa the sum of US$10m  (Ten million united state dollars) and deposited it =
with a private security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in =
Zimbabwe. This money is contained in a trunk box and he registered it as
family treasures and valuables for adequate security reason. 
 
The fund was meant to purchase new agricultural machines and chemicals for =
farming in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land dispute sparked off when =
president Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected he =
white farmer and some few black who vehemently condemned the modus oparandi =
adopted by the government, added with their party status. This resulted to =
rampage and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs in which =
more than fifty-one (51) people were killed including my father. May his soul =
rest in perfect peace. Heads of governments from the west especially Britain =
and America have voiced their condemnation against ugabe=92s plan.
As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine partner and account where this money will =
be transferred with out exposing the whole situation. I am faced with the =
dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the =
same experience in future since both countries have the almost the same =
political history. Moreso, South Africa monetary laws dose not allow
refuges/asylum seeker to engage on any  business activities neither are they =
allowed to open any bank account. Therefore, I am seeking for your very good =
assistance to transfer this money out of South Africa into your overseas =
chosen account. For your effort and assistance I have made up my mind to =
offer you 30% of the total fund, 5% for any unforeseen expenses that may =
occur during the process of the transaction and
65% will be for my investments in your country under your guidance.
Please should this request meet your utmost consideration kindly contact me =
via my e-mail and telephone above. Feel free to ask any question you consider =
necessary and in return try to include your private phone and fax numbers for =
easier nication. The confidentiality of this request can not be over =
emphasized as I have believe that you will oblige us in the need for security =
and attention it demands. Please treat this transaction with absolutely =
confidentiality and urgency it deserves and even if you are not in a position =
to render any assistance please your earlier information will be highly =
appreciated.
