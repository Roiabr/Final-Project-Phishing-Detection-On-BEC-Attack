Good Day Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. Femi Gidado, manager, credit and oreign bills of CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (C.B.N). I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account mber14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane 
crash [Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole assengers aboard on August 6, 1997.Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive 
as no one has come to claim his funds of $20 m, [twenty million united states dollars]which has been with my branch for a very long time.


On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name hall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay In view of this I got 
your contact while searching through the internet after realizing that your name and country is similar to the deceased.


I will give you 40% of the total sum. Upon the receipt of your sponse, I will send you by e-mail the application and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized with in five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a 
elation to the deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying your decision including your private or mobile Telephone numbers for quick communication.

Respectfully submitted,

BEST REGARDS
Mr. Femi Gidado
