From:Mr. Patrick K W. Chan.

Good Day ,

I am Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan. Executive Director and Chief Financial
Officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Col. Hosam Hassan who was with
the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit
for 18 calendar months, with a value of Thirty Million United State
Dollars($30,000,000.00) only in my branch.Upon maturity several notices
was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after
the war another notification was sent and still no response came from
him.We later find out that Col. Hosam Hassan along with his wife and only
daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their
home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that our client
Col.Hosam Hassan did not declare any next of kin in his official papers
including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in
me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his
deposit in my bank. So, Thirty Million United State
Dollars($30,000,000.00)is still lying in my bank and no one will ever
come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the la=
ws
of
my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds. Against this backdrop,my suggestion to you is that I will like
you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to  Col.Hosam Hassan so
thatyou will be able to receive his funds.

MODALITIES:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we
shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Col.
Hosam Hassan,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to
provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can comm=
ence
his job.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also
fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and o=
f
probate in yourfavour for the move of the funds to an account that will
be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we
are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all t=
he
necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in
all matters concerning this issue.

Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we
shall then share in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you.Should you be
interested please send me your,

1,Full names,
2,Private phone number,
3,Current residential address.

And I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below;

(pkwchan_hk@yahoo.com.hk)

and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this
operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan.
