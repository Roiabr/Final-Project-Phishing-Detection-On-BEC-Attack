Dear:Sir

Sequel to the secretive arrangement in regards of
the shipment of your contract sum USD$15.5m, I wish to inform
youthat all necessary modalities have been automatically
concluded and the payment has left Nigeria for London via
your Countrytoday by Express Cargo Flight.Note carefully
the content ofthe crate is "MONEY" but  C.B.N been
where the funds left did not disclose it to the Courier Services
as Money,rather the officail registered it as the crate contain
Vital"ANTIQUES/DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENTS" belonging to my client (that is
you).

Furthermore, the weight of the consignment is 220kg but
I,managed to pay for 120kg, which cost $16.000 and On no
account should you disclose the content of the crate with
the Diplomatic Courier Services AS MONEY for fear of betrayal.
In the meantime, contact the DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICES
