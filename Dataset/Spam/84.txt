>From the Address Book of mrsrose_mkama_200

Dear,

Iam Mrs. Rose Mkama from Benin. I was married to Manfred The CEO Veekrol Link Benin Sarl, a seasoned Contractor In West African Region. Before he died in The year 2002. We are married for eleven years Without a child. He died after a Brief illness. After His Death I decided not tore-marry or get a child Outside My matrimonial home. When my late husband was Alive, he deposited the sum of US$31.5m dollars (US Dollars) in a Bank In Nigeria. 

My Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Three months Due to cancer problem. Having known my Condition I decided to donate this funds to better the Lives of the less Privileged. I need honest and trust Worthy individual that will utilize this Money in Accordance With my instruction. I want the funds to be Used in funding religious Organizations, Orphanages And less privileged propagating the word of God. 

I took this decision because I don t have any child That will inherit this money and my husband relatives Are very unkind to me and I don t Want my husbands Hard-earned money to be misused. I am not afraid of Death hence I know where I am Going. I know that I Am Going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 Says that the Lord will fight my course and I shall Hold my peace. I Speak French and little English in Case you want a Telephone Communication in this 
Regard.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the Contact of the Bank, and my companies in Benin. For Legitimacy, I will also Issue you a letter of Authority that will empower you as the Original-Beneficiary of this fund. I want you to Always Pray for me, any delay in your Reply will give Me room in sourcing for another individual for this Same Purpose.

Yours sincerely
Mrs. Rose Mkama
