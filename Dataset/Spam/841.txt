From: Lady Peggy Morrison,
4 Old Church Street, Chelsea, SW3, England.
 
Here writes  Lady Peggy Morrison, suffering from cancerous ailment. I  am=

married to Engineer Richard Morrison an Englishman who is dead. My  husba=
nd
was into private practice all his life before his death.  Our life togeth=
er
as man and wife lasted for three decades without  child. My husband died
after aprotracted illness. My husband and  I made a vow to uplift the dow=
n-trodden
andthe less-privileged  individuals as he had passion for persons who can=

not help  themselves due to physical disability or financial predicament.=

I can adduce this to the fact that he needed a Child from this  relations=
hip,which
never came.
  
 When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 20  Million (20Mi=
llion
Great Britain Pounds Sterling which were  derived from his vast estates
a nd investment in capital market  with his bank here in UK. Presently,
this money is still with the  Bank.  Recently, my Doctor told me that I
have limited days to live  due to the cancerous problems I am suffering
from.  
 
Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition  to the=

cancer. With this hard reality that has befallen my family,  and me I hav=
e
decided to donate this fund to you and want you to  use this gift which
comes from my husbands effortto fund the  upkeep of widows, widowers, orp=
hans,
destitute, the down-trodden,physically challenged children, barren-women
and persons who prove  to be genuinely handicapped financially.
 
It is often said that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this  decis=
ion
because I do not have any child that will inherit this  money and my husb=
and
relatives are bourgeois and very wealthy  persons and I do not want my hu=
sbands
hard earned money to be  misused or invested into ill perceived ventures.=

I do not want a  situation where this money will be used in an ungodly ma=
nner,hence
the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of  death hence=
I
know where I am going. I know that I am going to be with the Almighty  wh=
en
Ieventually pass on. The Almighty will  fight my case and I shall hold my=

peace.
 
I do not need any  telephone communication in this regard due to my
deteriorating  health and because of the presence of my husbands relative=
s
around me. I do not want them to know about this development. With God al=
l
things are possible.
 
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of  the bank=

in UK. I will also issue you a Letter of Authority that  will empower you=

as the original beneficiary of this fund via my Lawyer. My  happiness is
that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Please  always be prayerful all
t hrough your life. Please assure me that  you will act just as I have st=
ated
herein. Hope to hear from you  soon and God bless you and members of your=

family.you can contact me through my private email address:

Good a thing to write you,which however is not mandatory nor will in any manner compel you to honour against your will.
 
Dearest we are Gordon and Rose Wiliams ,of our late Parents Mr and mrs Victor Williams. Our Father was a highly reputable business magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Lagos during His days. 
 
It is sad to say that He passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad.
 
Though His sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been  masterminded by an uncle of ours who travelled with Him at that time. But God knows the truth!Our mother died when we where small ,and since then our Father took us so special.
 
Before His death, My father called me and told  me that he has the sum of (USD$12.500,000) ( MILLION UNITED STATES  DOLLARS )deposited with an international bank in Republic Nigeria  west Africa. He further told me that He deposited the money with the name  of a business partner while I am the next of kin to the deposited money.
 

>From Gordon and Rose
We are just young 16 and 18 years old and a high school college people, with  little knowledge of business that is why We are in need of a partner whom  will assist us to get this fund released for investments in his or her country while I proceed with our education,
