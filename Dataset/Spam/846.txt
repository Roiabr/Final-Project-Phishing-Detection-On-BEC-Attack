Here writes  Lady Peggy Morrison, suffering from cancerous ailment. I  am=

married to Engineer Richard Morrison an Englishman who is dead. My  husba=
nd
was into private practice all his life before his death.  Our life togeth=
er
as man and wife lasted for three decades without  child. My husband died
after aprotracted illness. My husband and  I made a vow to uplift the dow=
n-trodden
andthe less-privileged  individuals as he had passion for persons who can=

not help  themselves due to physical disability or financial predicament.=

I can adduce this to the fact that he needed a Child from this  relations=
hip,which
never came.
  
 When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 20  Million (20Mi=
llion
Great Britain Pounds Sterling which were  derived from his vast estates
a nd investment in capital market  with his bank here in UK. Presently,
this money is still with the  Bank.  Recently, my Doctor told me that I
have limited days to live  due to the cancerous problems I am suffering
from.  
 
Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition  to the=

cancer. With this hard reality that has befallen my family,  and me I hav=
e
decided to donate this fund to you and want you to  use this gift which
comes from my husbands effortto fund the  upkeep of widows, widowers, orp=
hans,
destitute, the down-trodden,physically challenged children, barren-women
and persons who prove  to be genuinely handicapped financially.
 
It is often said that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this  decis=
ion
because I do not have any child that will inherit this  money and my husb=
and
relatives are bourgeois and very wealthy  persons and I do not want my hu=
sbands
hard earned money to be  misused or invested into ill perceived ventures.=

I do not want a  situation where this money will be used in an ungodly ma=
nner,hence
the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of  death hence=
I
know where I am going. I know that I am going to be with the Almighty  wh=
en
Ieventually pass on. The Almighty will  fight my case and I shall hold my=

peace.
 
I do not need any  telephone communication in this regard due to my
deteriorating  health and because of the presence of my husbands relative=
s
around me. I do not want them to know about this development. With God al=
l
things are possible.
 
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of  the bank=

in UK. I will also issue you a Letter of Authority that  will empower you=

as the original beneficiary of this fund via my Lawyer. My  happiness is
that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Please  always be prayerful all
t hrough your life. Please assure me that  you will act just as I have st=
ated
herein. Hope to hear from you  soon and God bless you and members of your=

family.you can contact me through my private email address:
