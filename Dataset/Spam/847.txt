Good a thing to write you,which however is not mandatory nor will in any manner compel you to honour against your will.
 
Dearest we are Gordon and Rose Wiliams ,of our late Parents Mr and mrs Victor Williams. Our Father was a highly reputable business magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Lagos during His days. 
 
It is sad to say that He passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad.
 
Though His sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been  masterminded by an uncle of ours who travelled with Him at that time. But God knows the truth!Our mother died when we where small ,and since then our Father took us so special.
 
Before His death, My father called me and told  me that he has the sum of (USD$12.500,000) ( MILLION UNITED STATES  DOLLARS )deposited with an international bank in Republic Nigeria  west Africa. He further told me that He deposited the money with the name  of a business partner while I am the next of kin to the deposited money.
 

>From Gordon and Rose
