DEAR BELOVED, 
 
I am Mrs. Christina Holden. 

Am married to Dr. Donald Holden. a Liberian who worked for Shell Oil 
Company in Nigeria,he died after a brief illness that lasted for only 
four days. Before his death we were married for 11 good years without a 
child and were both born again Christians . Since his death I decided
not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the 
Bible forbids. 
 
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million 
(Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank.Presently, 
this money is still under the safe keeping of the RESERVE FINANCE 
COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next 
Three(3) months due to my cancer problems. 

Though what disturbs me most now, i recently had stroke.Having known 
my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or betterstill a 
Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money theway I am 
going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on,
orphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God 
and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to 
understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision 
because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my 
husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard 
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation 
where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason 
for taking this bold decision. 
 
As soon as I receive your reply I will forward your personal 
information, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your 
telephone and fax number to my lawyer through his email  so that he 
will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be 
transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country. 
I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as 
the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want 
you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my 
shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund 
when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a 
life of a worthy Christian. 

Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and 
truth. Please always be
prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me 
room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same 
purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated 
herein.Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.
  
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. 

Yours in Christ, 

Mrs. Christina Holden.
