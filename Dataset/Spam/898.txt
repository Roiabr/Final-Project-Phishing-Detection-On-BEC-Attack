Dear respectful one,
   
  With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you would be of great assistance to me and my children.
   
  I am Mrs Josephine Kietha, the wife of the late Dr David E. Kietha Jr of blessed memory. Prior to my husband assassination by the rebel forces loyal to Corporal Foday Sankoh of the revolutionary United Front (RUF), he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation of
 Sierra-Leone.
   
  Few days before my husband was assassinated, he instructed me and my children (George and Henry) to move out of Sierra-Leone and also to go in his underground strong room where the documents of money he has deposited in a finance company in Abidjan Cote d'ivoire in one trunk box as family
 valuables and treasures with the name of my first son George as the beneficiary. The amount is US$9.000.000 (nine Million united states dollars).We managed to escape to Abidjan the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire through the help of my husband's friend who is a trawler. As our travelling document was
 seized.
   
  I am now looking for a trustworthy and God fearing person who will handle this money for rapid profit for the future of my two fatherless children.
   
  For your information, the finance company did not know the real content of the box and we do not wish them to know until the money is transferred to your account. As it was deposited as family valuables and treasures.
   
  Meanwhile, I want to leave Cote d Ivoire entirely for investment of this money in your country and mostly for the future of my children. I want you to please assist us to claim the box from the finance company and to deposit the money in your account as to order the bank to transfer the money to
 your account in your country. As our foreign partner.
  We have it in mind to reward you with a certain percentage for your assistance. As soon as we hear from you. Do not hesitate to call me on this line Tel:0022507923940 immediately you receive this letter to enable us proceed in earnest towards retrieving the box and transferring of the money into
 your account.
   
  Finally please ensure that no one else knows about this money as it is only myself my sons, yourself and the Rev. pastor of the church where we worship knows about this money.
   
  Yours sincerely,
Mrs Josephine  Kietha

Dear

Please let this letter not to bring confusion to you. I 
know that we have not met either before but hear me from 
the dept of your mind. It is circumstances that made to 
send this to you.

I will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a 
year ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in 
business. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he 
entered an agreement with my mother's brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mother's interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the company's lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the company's document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am 
contacting you.

I have been nick named bastard by my mother's relations, 
They have named me all source of names even calling me 
outcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mother's mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement 
she made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.

Please all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted 
to her company's costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I don't want the bank to know that my mother 
is late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.

(1).I want you to provide an account where the money will 
be remitted into as my mother's costumer. (2).Make 
arrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible
(3).How much commission you will take for rendering the 
assistant?

My mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only 
child while she was having an affair with the person that 
surpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the 
man abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to 
remain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father 
for a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I 
don't have any one to run into. All the members of my 
mother family have turned their back on me because I 
demand for me right. They told me that I don't belong to 
the family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom 
I don't know. I have made trace to know my father without 
sucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your 
heart and accord me this help.

God will bless you for saving my life and future.

Best wishes,
Miss Joy Kem.
