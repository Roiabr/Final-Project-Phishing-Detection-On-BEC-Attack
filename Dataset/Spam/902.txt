 Plan Crash. Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to =
locate any of my client=92s relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.=
 After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relati=
ves over the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no avail,=

y my client in one of the ECOBANK here. (cote d ivoire) Particularly, the=

tes Dollars only) in their custody within the next ten official working d=
ays. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3y=
ears now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the de=

ent on the sharing % of this fund before I commence on this funds on your=
 name as the next of Kin to Mr/Mrs.Robert Norton.
