Dear Friend,

I am Mr.David Ammer, the purchasing director African Millennium Villages =

 agency has been existing since over 3 years.=20
Our duty is to fight against rural poverty in Africa. This scheme has ove=

 farming to help lift African villages out of poverty.

Presently we have currently covers around 107 villages in 13 countries, i=
ncluding, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya. Under the sche=
me, villages are supplied with various materials, e.g. mosquito nets to p=
revent the spread of malaria, fertilizers, clothing of various kinds and =
treatment for people living with HIV/Aids. This scheme makes up part of t=
he UN'S Millennium Development Goals, which are internationally agreed ta=
rgets to cut poverty, hunger, disease and boots literacy by 2015 in Afric=

I am contacting you for a business; I would like you to register with our=
 agency as one of our foreign suppliers that supplys relief materials to =
our organization. I have about US$8MILLION to transfer into any secured b=
ank account abroad. The money is an over-invoiced contract amount execute=
d by a foreign supplier and commissioned with African Millennium Villages=
 project (AMVP), and the original supplier has been paid since march last=
 year remaining the over-invoiced amount of $8million. This was intention=
al and since then the US$8million has been in the suspense account of our=
 organization awaiting for claim. Now i am ready to transfer the fund(US$=
8million) overseas for our personal business investment and that is where=
 i need your assistance by providing me with a trusted bank account to re=
mit the fund. Then both of us will share the fund.

Now, how to start is just for me to pass through my attorney and register=
 your name/company as a sub-contract with African Millennium Villages pro=
ject, and the date of the registration will be back-dated to the date the=
 contract was awarded to the original supplier. Then you will serve among=
 the foreign suppliers that supplied relief material to our organization =
awaiting for payment.

lease if you are capable of working this project with me get back to me q=
uickly via thisemail:[mrammer2006@yahoo.ca] We will discuss on the sharin=
g modality of the fund if i receive your positive response. I will send y=
ou more details on how we are going to proceed on the claim. Note this pr=
oject is risk free and genue.With your corporation it will only take just=
 few weeks to accomplish our project.
