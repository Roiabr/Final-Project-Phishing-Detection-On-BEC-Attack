Dear Sir/madam,

I have a client who would like to invest in your country, and am currentl=

seeking for a reliable person to assist in facilitating the project, so
this prompts me to contact you for possible interest.

The total amount in question is US$9 Million (Nine Million United States
Dollars), and it is presently deposited in a security bank's vault. So my
client, being a known political figure in Liberia, handed me this project
and warned that he would want his name to remain a top secret.


Subsequently, you are to assist in the following areas:

1) Assist in investing of the said Amount
(2) Advise on lucrative areas of Investment
(3) Assist also in purchase of Properties.


If the proposal interest you, please call or email me on telephone number
+44 7787733565.So that we can arrange how to move the fund to your
country.

For your effort and support in the transaction, we have agreed to offer
you 15% of total sum of the fund (US$9Million) as your interest.

I am waiting for your urgent response. Please reply.

Thank you.

GRATEFULLY TREAT AS URGENT.
