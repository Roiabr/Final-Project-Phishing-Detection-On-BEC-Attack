My Dearest ONE
May the peace of gracious God be with you,please I have a problem which I 
needed a help from you,I have decided to write you for help.

I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any 
manner compel you to honour against your will.

I am in a state of delinma and made up my mind to send you this mail , I am 
ROSLINE MATHEW ,21 years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr. 
and Mrs. MATHEW NZOBEl.

My father was a highly reputable business magnet (a cocoa merchant) who 
operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of 
his bus iness trips abroad on 12th.Febuary 2004.

Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been 
masterminded by an
uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.

But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and 
since then my father took me so special.

Before his death on February 12 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied 
him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of eight million, seven 
hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$8.700,000) left in one of the 
leading security company.

He further told him that he depaosited the money in my name, and finally 
issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of 
all the necessary legal documents to this fund and the security company .

I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know 
what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result o 
f incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father 
actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble 
assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly 
regarded.

Now permit me to ask these few questions:-

1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter?

2. Can I completely trust you?

3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you 
after the money is in your account?

Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.

Thank you so much.Mey God bless you and your family.

My sincere regards,

ROSLIN MATHEW
