He has disclose to me a personal savings which he has managed to put
together to run the up coming election before his sudden stroke of 4th
January 2006.

Following the significant stroke suffered by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
in January 2006, a decision was reached by the Israeli Cabinet, under the
advice of the Attorney General of Israel: if the Prime Minister becomes
incapable of making decisions, power is transferred to the Deputy Prime
Minister ? at the time, Ehud Olmert ? who then becomes Acting Prime
Minister until the Prime Minister recovers. If the Prime Minister is
declared permanently incapacitated then the Acting Prime Minister remains
in office for 100 days. Once that period expires the President of Israel
oversees the process of assembling a new governing coalition If the Prime
Minister dies the Cabinet chooses a new Prime Minister. In this case,Ehud
Olmert is now the new prime minister.

The possibilities that Ariel Sharon will come back to that position is not
cancelled. He gave me the order to look for a reliable personnel of your
caliber to assist him in re-profiling a certain amount of funds which is
undisclosed at the moment before he into coma.As soon as I get your
willingness and confidentiality to forge ahead in executing  this
transaction, I will let you into confidential information on how to
execute the transaction. Meanwhile, Be aware that the percentage sharing
of the fund will be divided in this manner, 30 % will go to me and you
will get the  same 30% . The wife and children goes with 35% while 5%  is
used for any expenses  we may incurred in the process of transferring the
funds to your account. Thus, I am thanking you in advance for your
cooperation in finalizing with this transaction swiftly.Your response
