Dear Friend,

I will like to invest in your country. I am Samuel Dlovu from Liberia,the son of Michael Dlovu, former Minister of Mines and Industry. Our both parents were killed in the Liberia war. Our Father deposited trunk box containing 33.6 Million U.S Dollars with Global Security and Finance Company in Ghana, for safe keeping and before his death he instructed that I should claim it to look after my only sister and my self.

My sister and I are now in Accra Ghana-West Africa, to notify claims of the fund. We intend to invest this money abroad, hence my contacting you to advise us how best we can invest this money in your country. For your assistance I offer 20% of the money to you. We have all the vital documents covering the deposit fund and the ownership which I can send on request.

Please send your direct phone and fax numbers for more information on your reply.

Thank you very much for the anticipated acceptance while I expect your prompt response.

Best Regards,
Samuel Dlovu.
