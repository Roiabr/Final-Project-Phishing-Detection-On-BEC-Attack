Dear Friend,



I am Mr. Aphisak Tantiworawong , Managing Director Krung Thai Bank Plc,
Thailand and a Korean by Nationality. I am contacting you with respect to
a portfolio amounting to $42,520,000 USD (Thirty Five Million, Five
Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollar)  deposited by a
switzerland Merchant named Mr. Horst Schlegel.




On the 4th of August 2003  Mr.Horst Schlegel deposited $42,520,000.00 USD
(Forty Two illion, Five Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollar)
under our portfolio management department for three years and the deposit 
matured on the 3rd of August 2006 with over 136%  growth which  amounted
to a total of $58,099,200.00 USD (Fifty Eight Million  and Ninety Nine 
thousand Two United States  Dollar).Mr. Horst Schlegel, has since passed
away  without stating his next of kin because he never got  married nor
had
any childred during his existence and he was an orphan, this funds has
since matured and the roll-over on the funds has also expired.This sum of
$58,099,200.00 USD (Fifty Eight Million and Ninety Nine Thousand Two
United States  Dollar) is still  in my possession in my Bank lifeless and
unnoticed because there will never be a claim on the funds and all
material and immaterial  documents and certificates relating to the funds
are also in my
possession.





At the expiration of three years, such funds will revert to the ownership
of the Government for financing military operations, such as purchasing of
 arms and ammunitions for the military which is  in-line with the Asian
Tradition/Law.In order to avert this negative development, I will like to
seek for your permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr.
Horst Schlegel so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not
be use for financing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war
in the world in general.The money will be paid into your account for us to
share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you  and the balance of 5%
for  will be responsible for the  major /trivial expenses incurred in the
course of   the  transaction. There is no risk involved in this project as
my position in my bank and with the aid of my personal lawyer all
documents
will be provided to make you the legal beneficiary and the  legality of
this project  will correspond with local and international laws of
inheritance.




If you are interested, please reply immediately.Upon your response, I
shall then provide you with further information's and modalities that will
 help you understand the transaction.




You should observe utmost confidentiality, and  be rest assured that this
project would be most profitable for  both parties because I shall 
require your assistance  to invest my share in your country.




Awaiting your urgent reply.



Thanks and regards.


Mr. Aphisak Tantiworawong
