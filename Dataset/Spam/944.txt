Dear 
My name is Lillian A.Ofori I am the only daughter of
Late Nana A. Ofori the traditional Ruler of BIBIANI
before his death on 29th June 2003, after my mother=92s
death on 21st October 1986. It is my wish to inform
you that presently I am in the Kwame Nkrumah
university of Cape coast GHANA third year. 
Before the death of my father as a result of land
dispute and also the death of my mother, my father has
deposited 18million united state dollars in a bank
here in Accra Ghana ($6,500.000.00) in my name
through a financial consultant.

The firm has been taking care of me and recently a
good lady friend of my late father who has also been
helping me reveal to me about this treasure and with
her I CONTACTED the financial consultant firm and was
taken to the bank to meet with the manager of the
bank.

The bank manager has cooperated with us and has paid
off the financial firm as recorded in the agreement
the firm entered with my father. Because of the land
dispute that course the death of my father I will not
want to invest this money here in Ghana more over my
age as a young girl.

This informed my soliciting for your assistance for
the investment of this money. Any information you wish
to know concerning this fund and myself will be given
to you including the bank for you to contact the bank
and possible transfer of these fund to your chosen
account.

Most importantly it is my wish to be ADOPTED with you
till I am matured.  You will have 40% of the money.
God bless you while I wait for your urgent reply 

Lillian
