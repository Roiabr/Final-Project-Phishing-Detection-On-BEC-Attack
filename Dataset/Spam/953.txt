Calvary Greetings,

I am Mr. George Adams Audit Manager ECOBANK of AFRICA BENIN . In the capi=
tal
city of Cotonou Benin republic, and assistance, this is a very confidenti=
al
proposition for you. On April 21st 1999, A Swedish Oil consultant/contrac=
tor
with the Benenoise Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr.Soren Anderson made a
numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at
US$15,000,000.00 (fifteen Million Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturi=
ty on
November 20th 2003 as his Credit Officer, I sent a routine notification t=
o his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder an=
d
finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Benenoise Solid Min=
erals
Corporation that Mr.Soren Anderson died on auto accident with his entire
family.

Further investigations and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fru=
itless.
Again, I made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Soren Anderson=
 did
not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including=
 his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.

This sum of US$15,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank No one will ever=
 come
forward to claim it. According to the International Banking ethics, codes=
 and
Laws, at the expiration of 7(Two) years, the money will revert to the own=
ership
of the Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand=
 in as
the next of kin to Mr.Soren. This is simple, I will like you to respond
immediately with your full names and address so that we will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next=
 of
kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the rati=
o of
70% for me and some of my colleagues who are aware of this transaction an=
d 25%
for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction The=
re is
no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by =
my
colleagues and with my position as the Foreign Remittance Director guaran=
tees
the successful execution of this transaction.

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and releva=
nt
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me y=
our
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. You should
observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction=
 would
be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance=
 to
invest my share in your country.
Reply me in my Private email;

Awaiting your urgent reply.
Remain Bless.
Mr.George Adams
