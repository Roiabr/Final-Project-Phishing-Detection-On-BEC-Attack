Dear=2ESir

       It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail=2E I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet=2E 
My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed=2C a Liberian=2E I was until recently the wife of Mr=2E Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera=2E I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10=2EM in your company or your country=2Cs economy=2E

My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia=2E
Due to some religious and political problems =2C my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia=2E
It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question=2E
This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond =2Cwhich are the country's major resources and sources of income=2EAnd before his death =2Cmy husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country =2Cwhere it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE
 and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband=2Cs position as an insider in the government=2E
And it was my husband=2Cs refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003=2E
Now =2C that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money=2E
So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit=2E I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type=2E  
I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture=2E
Please reply to this mail=2C indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project=2E 

Best regards=2C
