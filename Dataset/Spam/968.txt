Dear Friend,

My Compliment to you,

I guess this letter may come to you as a surprise since I had no =20
previous correspondence with you.

I am sending you this mail on behalf of the tender board of the Niger =20
Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which is in charge of managing =20
and supervising the disbursement of oil sales revenues for the =20
Nigerian government which covers payment to foreign and local =20
contractors that have executed contracts for our country. The revenue =20
under our control runs into several hundred of millions of dollars =20
monthly.

We came across your contact in our search for a reliable person to =20
handle a very confidential transaction involving the transfer of Nine =20
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$9.500m). This =20
fund was accrued from various over invoicing of foreign contractors' =20
payments made over the years. The contract has long been executed and =20
payment of the actual contract amount has been paid to the foreign =20
contractor. The balance of the actual contract is what my colleagues =20
and I now interested in transferring out of Nigeria into a reliable =20
foreign account for our personal use.

As civil servants we are not allowed to run foreign accounts. Hence we =20
have chosen you to front and support us as the beneficiary to be paid. =20
If you are interested in this proposal, kindly get back to me by =20
sending me your letter of acceptance along with your direct telephone =20
and fax numbers. For your support and partnership, please reply me to =20
negotiate your fees or the percentage you wish to be paid when the =20
funds are transferred into your bank account.

Further details about this transaction will be discussed in the =20
subsequent correspondence. Note also that the particular nature of =20
your business is irrelevant to this transaction and all local contacts =20
and arrangements are in place for a smooth and successful conclusion =20
of this transaction.

We will appreciate that you treat this proposal with utmost attention, =20
knowing fully well that you cannot and will not be compelled to assist =20
us if you are not disposed to.

I will be in UK on official assignment probably in a week=92s time. I =20
can be contacted via this email account drahmedsuleman@gmail.com  I =20
will appreciate that you forward to me your contact telephone and fax =20
numbers on responding to this mail; I will endeavour to call you for =20
detailed discussion on the proposal.

Thank you as I await your response.

Sincerely,

Dr. Ahmed.
