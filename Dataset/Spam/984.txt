Dear Friend,

I need your services in a confidential matter regarding 
money out of a family beneficiary deposit for investment in your 
country as such i decided to establish contact with you for assistance.

This requires a private arrangement.

You will receive these funds 
under legal claims; all legal documents will be carefully worked out 
to ensure a risky free transfer.

I am willing to pay a generous 
management fee as well as appreciation as soon as this transaction is 
completed.

I have all the details. All correspondences will be via 
email, for now. The funds in question are quite large. I will expect a 
straight answer from you. Yes or no.

If yes, Kindly furnish me with 
your personal information which must includ your full information,

1) 
Your full name.
2) Phone, fax and mobile #.
3) Company name, position 
and address.
4) Profession, age and marital status.
5) A scanned copy 
of your int'l p/port/Drivers license for identification.

Please Send 
me an e-mail as soon as you receive this letter for further discussion 
and more clarification.

Thanks and God

bless you.

Dr. Chinedu Ego.
