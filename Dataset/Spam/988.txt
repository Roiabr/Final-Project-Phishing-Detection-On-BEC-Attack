Mr.SAMUEL PETTERS
BOA Bank of Africa

Burkina Faso in West Africa



Dear Friend,



I am Mr.SAMUEL PETTERS

The Furring Remittance Director of BOA

Bank of Africa.

.





I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On September

4, 2001, Mr Werner Karl Ruddigkeit, a National of German, who used to be a

Private contractor with the Shell Petroleum Development Company in Saudi 
Arabia Mr. Werner Karl Ruddigkeit Made a numbered time (Fixed deposit) for 
36

Calendar months, valued at GBP£30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million Pounds only) in

My branch.



Upon maturity in 2004, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding

Address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we

Discovered from his contract employers, Shell Petroleum Development Company 
in

Saudi Arabia that Mr. Werner Karl Ruddigkeit and his wife with their three

Children were involved in an auto crash, all occupants

Of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.



On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, 
and

All attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made 
further

Investigation and discovered that Mr. Werner Karl Ruddigkeit. Did not 
declare

Any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his 
Bank

Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of GBP£30.000, 000.00 have been

Floating as unclaimed

Since 2001 in my bank as all efforts to get his relatives have hit the 
stones.

According to the Burkina Faso law at the expiration of 5 FIVE) years, the 
Money will

Revert to the ownership of the Burkina Faso Government if nobody applies to 
claim

The fund and the FIVE years is the end of DECEMBER 2006.



Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years 
now,

I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin / Will Beneficiary to

The deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at 
GBP£30,000,000.00

Can be paid to you. This will be disbursed or shared in these percentages, 
60%

To me and 40% to you.



I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim 
we

May make. All I require is your honest Co-operation, Confidentiality and 
Trust

To enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be

Executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any 
breach

Of the law. Please, provide me with the following;



1. Full Name

2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number

3. Your Contact Address

4. Age



Your urgent response will be highly anticipated and appreciated.



Best regards,



Mr. SAMUEL PETTERS
