branch Dubai United Arab Emirate (U.A.E.)
Email;mr_mustaphasalleh@yahoo.com
Dear, 
I am Mr. Mustapha Salleh Manager National Bank of Dubai Abu Dhabi branch, I =
have urgent and very confidential business proposition foryou. A British Oil =
consultant and contractor with the Kruger Gold Company, Mr. Raymond Beck made =
a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25m =
(Twenty Five Million United States American Dollars). in my branch. 
Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got =
no reply.After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his =
contract employers, the Kruger Gold Company that Mr. Raymond Beck died in a =
plane crash along with his wife Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Beck died in a plan =
crash along with his wife in Egypt Air Flight 990,1999 air
crash (for more information about this crash and person you can contact this =
website<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm>
Since we got this information about his death and on further investigation, I =
found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his =
next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and =
discovered that Mr. Raymond Beck did not declare any kin or relations in all =
his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
This sum of US$25m (Twenty Five Million United States American Dollars).is =
still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the =
principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim =
it. According to Laws of United Arab Emirates, at the expiration of 7 (seven) =
years, the money will revert to the ownership of the (U.A.E) Government if =
nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in =
as the next of kin to Mr. Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this old man's =
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This =
is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address =
so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that =
will put you in place as the next of kin. 
We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of =
the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of =
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any =
part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of =
this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into =
your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. =
There is no risk at all as all the paper work for this transaction will be =
done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the =
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply =
immediately via the private email address above. 
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant =
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your =
confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe =
utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most =
profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest =
my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply.
Regards.
Mr.Mustapha salleh.
