My Dear
 
My name is Rev Father Felix; I am 76 years old now. I have 
been suffering in the sick bed for the past 7 years. Now I believe 
that 
my time has come to join my ancestors in heaven. I got your 
email 
address from the Internet, as the spirit of Almighty God 
directed me to 
contact you for this charity work. I have 
$18,000,000.00 deposited in a 
safe location, which I want you to claim 
on my behalf for an important 
charitable project.  Can you honestly do 
this for me? 
Remain bless in 
the Lord.
Rev Felix.
