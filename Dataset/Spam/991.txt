Beloved In Christ,
 
I am Ms Sharma Taylor, Secret Wife and Personal Assistant to former Liberian Rebel Leader Charles Taylor now standing trial for war crime. In this capacity, we committed alot of crimes and atrocities against humanity and God.
 
Although, am now a Christian convert in my new base in London, but diagnosed of terminal disease. I believe God and I know that I will not die, but will live to declare the glory of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ is my only comforter having lost the beauty of life through the death of my only daughter in the Liberian War.
 
I diverted the sum of nine million, five hundred thousand US Dollars ($9.5Mi). The fund is presently deposited in a finance company in Europe for security reasons and all the documents concerning the fund are in the custody of my lawyer.
 
I have prayed concerning this donation for God's guidance and if in your heart you genuinely and faithfully desire to use this fund for the propagation of God's work in any form whether for charity, ministry, evangelical mission or otherwise for the benefit of humanity and glory of God, do get in touch with me for possible communication with my lawyer on how you will receive my donation.please note my alternative email address: sharmataylor4@yahoo.fr
 
God bless you and as you receive give God the glory.
Ms Sharma Taylor.
