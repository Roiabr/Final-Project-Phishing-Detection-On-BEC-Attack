FROM THE DESK OF  MR YUSUF  ALI
BANK OF AFRICA [BOA]
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.
Email;yusuf_ali778@yahoo.fr
                                              TOP  SECRET
I am  YUSUF ALI,the director in charge of auditing and accounting
section of BANK OF AFRICA,Ouagadougou Burkina faso West Africa with due 
respect and regard.I have decided to contact you on a business transaction 
that  will be very beneficial to both of  us at the end of the 
transaction.During our investigation  and auditing in this bank , my 
department came across a very huge sum of money  belonging  to a deceased 
person  who
died on July 2000 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his 
account
with this Bank with out any claim of the fund  in our custody either
from his family or relation before our discovery to this developement.

The said amount was EIGHTHEEN MILLION united states
dollars.($18000.000.00)Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put the
claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased;get the
required approval and transfer this money to a foriegn account  has  been 
put in
place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you  as
soon as  you indicate your  interest and willingness to assist us and  also
benefit your self to this great business
opportunity.

Infact i could have done this deal alone  but because  of my position
in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not  allowed  to
operate  a  oriegn account and would eventually  raise  an eye  brow  on my 
side
during  the time of transfer becuase i work  in this bank. This is the
reason why it will require  a second party or fellow  who  will forward
claims  as the next of kin to the bank  and  also present  a foriegn
account

where he will need the money  to be  retransferred into  on his request
as it may be after due verification and clarification by the
correspondent branch  of the bank where the  money will be remitted from to 
your own
designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this 
transaction  is 100%    risk
free.On smooth conclusion of this  transaction;you will be entitled  to 
30%of
the total  sum as gratification;while5% will be set aside to take care of
expenses that may arise during the time of  transfer   and also telephone
bills; while65%will be for me.Please;you have been adviced to keep  top
secret as i am still in service and intend to retire  from service
after we conclude  this deal with you.

I will be monitoring  the whole  situation here in this bank  until you
confirm the money  in your account  and ask  me to come  down to your
country  for subsequent sharing of the fund according  to  percentages
previously  indicated and further investment,either in  your country or
any country  you advice us to invest.All other necessary vital  information
will be sent to  you when i hear from you.

I  look forward to  receive your email .
Yours  faithfully
YUSUF ALI.
